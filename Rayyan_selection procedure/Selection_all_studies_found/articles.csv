Studies are limited in scope and replication. Objectives: To conduct large-scale epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation and pulmonary function. Methods: Twelve cohorts analyzed associations of methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine probes (CpGs), using Illumina 450K or EPIC/850K arrays, with FEV(1), FVC, and FEV(1)/FVC. We performed multiancestry epigenome-wide meta-analyses (total of 17,503 individuals; 14,761 European, 2,549 African, and 193 Hispanic/Latino ancestries) and interpreted results using integrative epigenomics. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 1,267 CpGs (1,042 genes) differentially methylated (false discovery rate, <0.025) in relation to FEV(1), FVC, or FEV(1)/FVC, including 1,240 novel and 73 also related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1,787 cases). We found 294 CpGs unique to European or African ancestry and 395 CpGs unique to never or ever smokers. The majority of significant CpGs correlated with nearby gene expression in blood. Findings were enriched in key regulatory elements for gene function, including accessible chromatin elements, in both blood and lung. Sixty-nine implicated genes are targets of investigational or approved drugs. One example novel gene highlighted by integrative epigenomic and druggable target analysis is TNFRSF4. Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses suggest that epigenome-wide association study signals capture causal regulatory genomic loci. Conclusions: We identified numerous novel loci differentially methylated in relation to pulmonary function; few were detected in large genome-wide association studies. Integrative analyses highlight functional relevance and potential therapeutic targets. This comprehensive discovery of potentially modifiable, novel lung function loci expands knowledge gained from genetic studies, providing insights into lung pathogenesis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1164/rccm.202108-1907OC,"CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation/genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics;*Epigenome;Epigenomics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Lung;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation",35536696,PMC9890261

DNA methylation patterns can serve as proxies of (past) exposures and disease progression, as well as providing a potential mechanism that mediates genetic or environmental risk. Here, we present a blood-based epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis in 9706 samples passing stringent quality control (6763 patients, 2943 controls). We identified a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42 genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related to metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We then tested 39 DNA methylation-based proxies of putative ALS risk factors and found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, white blood cell proportions, and alcohol intake were independently associated with ALS. Integration of these results with our latest genome-wide association study showed that cholesterol biosynthesis was potentially causally related to ALS. Last, DNA methylation at several DMPs and blood cell proportion estimates derived from DNA methylation data were associated with survival rate in patients, suggesting that they might represent indicators of underlying disease processes potentially amenable to therapeutic interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1126/scitranslmed.abj0264,"*Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/genetics;Cholesterol;DNA Methylation/genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;*Neurodegenerative Diseases/genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Genome;Genomics;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Methylation;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;DNA",35196023,PMC10040186

These CpG sites show correlation structures across chromosomes, and are primarily situated in euchromatin, depleted in CpG islands. These genomic loci are predominantly situated in transcription factor binding sites and genomic enhancer regions. Mendelian randomization analysis suggests altered CpG methylation is a consequence of increased blood CRP levels.

However, the role of DYSF in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) and the regulation mechanism of DYSF expression have not been fully studied. In this study, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) literatures were searched to find the DNA methylation-driven genes (including DYSF) of ASCVD. The hub genes related to DYSF were also identified through weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Regulation of DYSF expression through its promoter methylation status was verified using peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) from ASCVD patients and normal controls, and experiments on THP1 cells and Apoe(-/-) mice. Similarly, the expressions of DYSF related hub genes, mainly contained SELL, STAT3 and TMX1, were also validated. DYSF functions were then evaluated by phagocytosis, transwell and adhesion assays in DYSF knock-down and overexpressed THP1 cells. The results showed that DYSF promoter hypermethylation up-regulated its expression in clinical samples, THP1 cells and Apoe(-/-) mice, confirming DYSF as a DNA methylation-driven gene. The combination of DYSF expression and methylation status in PBLs had a considerable prediction value for ASCVD. Besides, DYSF could enhance the phagocytosis, migration and adhesion ability of THP1 cells. Among DYSF related hub genes, SELL was proven to be the downstream target of DYSF by wet experiments. In conclusion, DYSF promoter hypermethylation upregulated its expression and promoted monocytes activation, which further participated in the pathogenesis of ASCVD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No EWAS,No environmental factor",10.1016/j.trsl.2022.04.001,Animals;Apolipoproteins E/metabolism;*Atherosclerosis/genetics/metabolism;*Cardiovascular Diseases/metabolism;*DNA Methylation;*Dysferlin/genetics/metabolism;Humans;Mice;Monocytes/metabolism;Monocytes;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Cardiovascular Diseases,35460889,

Despite the successful identification of multiple genetic variants associated with this highly heritable condition, its genetic architecture remains incompletely understood. More specifically, the role of DNA methylation has received little attention. We investigated the association between white matter hyperintensity burden and DNA methylation in blood at ∼450 000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in 9732 middle-aged to older adults from 14 community-based studies. Single CpG and region-based association analyses were carried out. Functional annotation and integrative cross-omics analyses were performed to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and white matter hyperintensities. We identified 12 single CpG and 46 region-based DNA methylation associations with white matter hyperintensity burden. Our top discovery single CpG, cg24202936 (P = 7.6 × 10-8), was associated with F2 expression in blood (P = 6.4 × 10-5) and co-localized with FOLH1 expression in brain (posterior probability = 0.75). Our top differentially methylated regions were in PRMT1 and in CCDC144NL-AS1, which were also represented in single CpG associations (cg17417856 and cg06809326, respectively). Through Mendelian randomization analyses cg06809326 was putatively associated with white matter hyperintensity burden (P = 0.03) and expression of CCDC144NL-AS1 possibly mediated this association. Differentially methylated region analysis, joint epigenetic association analysis and multi-omics co-localization analysis consistently identified a role of DNA methylation near SH3PXD2A, a locus previously identified in genome-wide association studies of white matter hyperintensities. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed functions of the identified DNA methylation loci in the blood-brain barrier and in the immune response. Integrative cross-omics analysis identified 19 key regulatory genes in two networks related to extracellular matrix organization, and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. A drug-repositioning analysis indicated antihyperlipidaemic agents, more specifically peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, as possible target drugs for white matter hyperintensities. Our epigenome-wide association study and integrative cross-omics analyses implicate novel genes influencing white matter hyperintensity burden, which converged on pathways related to the immune response and to a compromised blood-brain barrier possibly due to disrupted cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The results also suggest that antihyperlipidaemic therapy may contribute to lowering risk for white matter hyperintensities possibly through protection against blood-brain barrier disruption.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/brain/awac290,"Middle Aged;Humans;Aged;*White Matter/diagnostic imaging;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Brain/diagnostic imaging;DNA Methylation/genetics;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Epigenesis, Genetic;Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases;Repressor Proteins;European Continental Ancestry Group;Epigenomics",35943854,PMC9924914

Numerous genetic and environmental factors, from conception onwards, may influence this phenotype. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been proposed to underlie variation in sleep or may be an early-life marker of sleep disturbances. We examined if DNA methylation at birth or in school age is associated with parent-reported and actigraphy-estimated sleep outcomes in children. METHODS: We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association study results. DNA methylation was measured from cord blood at birth in 11 cohorts and from peripheral blood in children (4-13 years) in 8 cohorts. Outcomes included parent-reported sleep duration, sleep initiation and fragmentation problems, and actigraphy-estimated sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake-after-sleep-onset duration. RESULTS: We found no associations between DNA methylation at birth and parent-reported sleep duration (n = 3658), initiation problems (n = 2504), or fragmentation (n = 1681) (p values above cut-off 4.0 × 10(-8)). Lower methylation at cg24815001 and cg02753354 at birth was associated with longer actigraphy-estimated sleep duration (p = 3.31 × 10(-8), n = 577) and sleep onset latency (p = 8.8 × 10(-9), n = 580), respectively. DNA methylation in childhood was not cross-sectionally associated with any sleep outcomes (n = 716-2539).

The underlying mechanisms that lead to these outcomes are unclear, but long-term changes in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, could act as a mediating factor or biomarker. DNA methylation data were assayed at 713 522 CpG sites from 9537 participants of the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, a family-based cohort with extensive genetic, medical, family history and lifestyle information. Methylome-wide association studies of eight early life environment phenotypes and two adult mental health phenotypes (major depressive disorder and brief resilience scale) were conducted using DNA methylation data collected from adult whole blood samples. Two genes involved with different developmental pathways (PRICKLE2, Prickle Planar Cell Polarity Protein 2 and ABI1, Abl-Interactor-1) were annotated to CpG sites associated with preterm birth (P < 1.27 × 10-9). A further two genes important to the development of sensory pathways (SOBP, Sine Oculis Binding Protein Homolog and RPGRIP1, Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator Interacting Protein) were annotated to sites associated with low birth weight (P < 4.35 × 10-8). The examination of methylation profile scores and genes and gene-sets annotated from associated CpGs sites found no evidence of overlap between the early life environment and mental health conditions. Birth date was associated with a significant difference in estimated lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Previous studies have shown that early life environments influence the risk of developing mental health disorders later in life; however, this study found no evidence that this is mediated by stable changes to the methylome detectable in peripheral blood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,early life stressors | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1093/hmg/ddab274,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing;Child, Preschool;CpG Islands/genetics;Cytoskeletal Proteins;DNA Methylation/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major;Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenome;Female;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Mental Health;Pregnancy;*Premature Birth",34523677,PMC8863421

METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 1938 blood samples (982 participants) from the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). We estimated residential greenness based on normalized difference vegetation index at 30 × 30 m cell (green30) and 500 m buffer (green500) around the residential address.

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have mainly investigated DNA methylation and its association with disease or traits, exposure factors or gene expression. This systematic review aimed to identify all EWAS assessing differentially methylated sites associated with asthma in humans. DESIGN: Structured systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies was used for bias assessment. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed and Embase databases from 2005 to 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Epigenome-wide association studies testing association between differential methylation and asthma in humans. RESULTS: Overall, we identified 16 EWAS studies complying with our search criteria. Twelve studies were conducted on children, and 10 were conducted on sample sizes <150 subjects. Four hundred and nineteen CpGs were reported in children studies after correction for multiple testing. In the adult studies, thousands of differentially methylated sites were identified. Differential methylation in inflammatory-related genes correlated with higher levels of gene expressions of inflammatory modulators in asthma. Differentially methylated genes associated with asthma included SMAD3, SERPINC1, PROK1, IL13, RUNX3 and TIGIT.

CONCLUSION: Although many differentially methylated CpGs in genes known to be involved in asthma have been identified in EWAS to date, we conclude that further studies of larger sample sizes and analyses of differential methylation between different phenotypes are needed in order to comprehensively evaluate the role of epigenetic factors in the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of asthma, and the potential clinical utility to predict or classify patients with asthma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Is systematic review,No environmental factor",10.1111/cea.13403,"Asthma/*genetics/*immunology;CpG Islands/*immunology;DNA Methylation/*immunology;Epigenesis, Genetic/*immunology;Epigenome/*immunology;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Asthma;Epigenomics",31009112,

Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC array data from 221 decedents (120 European American [23% current smokers], 101 African American [26% current smokers]) were analyzed. DNAm by smoking (current vs. nonsmoking) was tested within each ancestry group using robust linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, cell-type proportion, DNAm-derived negative control principal components (PCs), and genotype-derived PCs. The resulting ancestry-specific results were combined via meta-analysis. We extended our NAc findings, using published smoking EWAS results in blood, to identify DNAm smoking effects that are unique (tissue-specific) vs. shared between tissues (tissue-shared). We identified seven CpGs (false discovery rate < 0.05), of which three CpGs are located near genes previously indicated with blood-based smoking DNAm biomarkers: ZIC1, ZCCHC24, and PRKDC. The other four CpGs are novel for smoking-related DNAm changes: ABLIM3, APCDD1L, MTMR6, and CTCF. None of the seven smoking-related CpGs in NAc are driven by genetic variants that share association signals with predisposing genetic risk variants for smoking, suggesting that the DNAm changes reflect consequences of smoking. Our results provide the first evidence for smoking-related DNAm changes in human NAc, highlighting CpGs that were undetected as peripheral biomarkers and may reflect brain-specific responses to smoking exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No Blood samples",10.1038/s41386-020-0782-0,"*DNA Methylation;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Non-Smokers;Nucleus Accumbens;Smokers;Smoking/genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Genome;Genomics;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",32731254,PMC8027202

We aimed to evaluate the association between surrounding greenness and genome-wide DNA methylation and potential gene-greenness interaction effects on DNA methylation. METHODS: We measured blood-derived DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina) for 479 Australian women, including 66 monozygotic, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of these twins. Surrounding greenness was represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) within 300, 500, 1000 or 2000 m surrounding participants' home addresses. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), the associations between its methylation level and NDVI or EVI were evaluated by generalized estimating equations, after adjusting for age, education, marital status, area-level socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, cell-type proportions, and familial clustering. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For each significant CpG, we evaluated the interaction effects of greenness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±1 Mb window on its methylation level. RESULTS: We found associations between surrounding greenness and blood DNA methylation for one CpG (cg04720477, mapped to the promoter region of CNP gene) with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05, and for another 9 CpGs with 0.05 ≤ FDR < 0.10. For two of these CpGs, we found 33 SNPs significantly (FDR < 0.05) modified the greenness-methylation association. There were 35 significant DMRs related to surrounding greenness that were identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Those CpGs and DMRs were mapped to genes related to many human diseases, such as mental health disorders and neoplasms as well as nutritional and metabolic diseases.

Decreased eGFR is more common among US Hispanics and African Americans. The causes for this are poorly understood. We aimed to identify trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with eGFR using an agnostic, genome-wide approach. METHODS: The study included up to 5428 participants from multi-ethnic studies for discovery and 8109 participants for replication. We tested the associations between whole blood DNAm and eGFR using beta values from Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. Ethnicity-stratified analyses were performed using linear mixed models adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and study-specific and technical variables. Summary results were meta-analyzed within and across ethnicities. Findings were assessed using integrative epigenomics methods and pathway analyses. RESULTS: We identified 93 DMPs associated with eGFR at an FDR of 0.05 and replicated 13 and 1 DMPs across independent samples in trans-ethnic and African American meta-analyses, respectively. The study also validated 6 previously published DMPs. Identified DMPs showed significant overlap enrichment with DNase I hypersensitive sites in kidney tissue, sites associated with the expression of proximal genes, and transcription factor motifs and pathways associated with kidney tissue and kidney development. CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific DMPs associated with eGFR, including DMPs enriched in regulatory elements in kidney tissue and pathways related to kidney development.

This study sought to fill an important knowledge gap: the link of cord DNAm with child postnatal growth trajectories from birth to age 18 years (y). METHODS: Using data from a US predominantly urban, low-income, multi-ethnic birth cohort (N = 831), we first applied non-parametric methods to identify body-mass-index percentile (BMIPCT) trajectories from birth to age 18 y (the outcome); then, conducted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of the outcome, interrogating over 700,000 CpG sites profiled by the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Multivariate linear regression models and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were applied to examine the DNAm-outcome association in the overall sample and sex strata. FINDINGS: We identified four distinct patterns of BMIPCT trajectories: normal weight (NW), Early overweight or obesity (OWO), Late OWO, and normal to very late OWO. DNAm at CpG18582997 annotated to TPGS1, CpG15241084 of TLR7, and cg24350936 of RAB31 were associated with BMIPCT at birth-to-3 y, 10 y, and 14 y, respectively (LRT FDR < 0.05 for all). INTERPRETATION: In this prospective birth cohort study, we identified 4 distinct and robust patterns of growth trajectories from birth to 18 y, which were associated with variations in cord blood DNAm at genes implicated in inflammation induction pathways. These findings, if further replicated, raise the possibility that these DNAm markers along with early assessment of BMIPCT trajectories may help identify young children at high-risk for obesity later in life.

The association between CpG methylation and lead level was analyzed using the limma package, with adjusting for infant sex, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, and estimated leukocyte composition. RESULTS: Among 364 blood samples (182 males and 182 females), those for which maternal and cord blood lead concentrations during early and later pregnancy was known were used for analysis. Maternal lead concentration in blood during early pregnancy was significantly associated with the methylation status of specific positions. After data stratification by infant sex, we found that, in males, the level of maternal blood lead was associated with 18 CpG sites during early pregnancy, and with one CpG site near the NBAS gene, during late pregnancy. In female samples, there was no significant association between DNA methylation and lead concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal lead exposure was associated with altered, gender-specific patterns of DNA methylation in Korean infants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1016/j.envres.2021.110767,"CpG Islands;DNA Methylation;*Exposome;Female;Fetal Blood/metabolism;Humans;Infant;Lead/metabolism/toxicity;Male;Maternal Exposure/adverse effects;Pregnancy;*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/genetics;Republic of Korea;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Fetal Blood;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation",33515580,

This study aimed to evaluate the association between ambient temperature and DNA methylation across human genome. We included 479 Australian women, including 132 twin pairs and 215 sisters of these twins. Blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Data on average ambient temperature during eight different exposure windows [lag0d (the blood draw day), lag0-7d (the current day and previous seven days prior to blood draw), lag0-14d, lag0-21d, lag0-28d, lag0-90d, lag0-180d, and lag0-365d)] was linked to each participant's home address. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), we evaluated the association between its methylation level and temperature using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting for important covariates. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We identified 31 CpGs at which blood DNA methylation were significantly associated with ambient temperature with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05. There were 82 significant DMRs identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Most of these CpGs and DMRs only showed association with temperature during one specific exposure window. These CpGs and DMRs were mapped to 85 genes. These related genes have been related to many human chronic diseases or phenotypes (e.g., diabetes, arthritis, breast cancer, depression, asthma, body height) in previous studies. The signals of short-term windows (lag0d and lag0-21d) showed enrichment in biological processes related to cell adhesion. In conclusion, short-, medium-, and long-term exposures to ambient temperature were all associated with blood DNA methylation, but the target genomic loci varied by exposure window. These differential methylation signals may serve as potential biomarkers to understand the health impacts of temperature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ambient temperature",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117700,"Australia;*DNA;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Humans;Temperature;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Genomics;Twins;Genome",34380236,

To investigate a potential association between fathers' smoking exposures and offspring DNA methylation using epigenome-wide association studies. We used data from 195 males and females (11-54 years) participating in two population-based cohorts. DNA methylation was quantified in whole blood using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip. Comb-p was used to analyse differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Robust multivariate linear models, adjusted for personal/maternal smoking and cell-type proportion, were used to analyse offspring differentially associated probes (DMPs) related to paternal smoking. In sensitivity analyses, we adjusted for socio-economic position and clustering by family. Adjustment for inflation was based on estimation of the empirical null distribution in BACON. Enrichment and pathway analyses were performed on genes annotated to cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites using the gometh function in missMethyl. We identified six significant DMRs (Sidak-corrected P values: 0.0006-0.0173), associated with paternal smoking, annotated to genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity, fatty acid synthesis, development and function of neuronal systems and cellular processes.

METHODS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify CpGs related to CVD development in a Chinese population.We adopted a nested case-control design based on data from China PEACE Million Persons Project. A total of 83 cases who developed CVD events during follow-up and 83 controls who were matched with cases by age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, medications treatment and behavior risk factors were included in the discovery stage. Genome-wide DNA methylation from whole blood was detected using Infinium Human Methylation EPIC Beadchip (850 K).

DNA methylation (DNAm) is a dynamic regulator of gene expression that may offer insight into PE pathophysiology and/or serve as a biomarker (e.g., risk, subtype, a therapeutic response). This study's purpose was to evaluate for differences in blood-based DNAm across all trimesters between individuals eventually diagnosed with PE (cases) and individuals who remained normotensive throughout pregnancy, did not develop proteinuria, and birthed a normally grown infant (controls). RESULTS: In the discovery phase, longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated across three trimesters of pregnancy in 56 participants (n=28 cases, n=28 controls) individually matched on self-identified race, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, and gestational age at sample collection. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was conducted, using surrogate variable analysis to account for unwanted sources of variation. No CpGs met the genome-wide significance p value threshold of 9×10(-8), but 16 CpGs (trimester 1: 5; trimester 2: 1; trimester 3: 10) met the suggestive significance threshold of 1×10(-5). DNAm data were also evaluated for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by PE status. Three DMRs in each trimester were significant after Bonferonni-adjustment. Since only third-trimester samples were available from an independent replication sample (n=64 cases, n=50 controls), the top suggestive hits from trimester 3 (cg16155413 and cg21882990 associated with TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2 genes, which also made up the top DMR) were carried forward for replication. During replication, DNAm data were also generated for validation purposes from discovery phase third trimester samples. While significant associations between DNAm and PE status were observed at both sites in the validation sample, no associations between DNAm and PE status were observed in the independent replication sample. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery phase findings for cg16155413/cg21882990 (TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2) were validated with a new platform but were not replicated in an independent sample. Given the differences in participant characteristics between the discovery and replication samples, we cannot rule out important signals for these CpGs.

RESULTS: We found little evidence of an association at either time point: at all CpGs, the false-discovery-rate-adjusted P-values were >0.05. In secondary sex-stratified analyses, we found just four CpGs for which there was robust evidence of an association in female offspring. To compare our findings to those of other studies, we conducted a systematic review, which identified seven studies, including five candidate gene studies showing associations between paternal BMI/obesity and offspring or sperm DNA methylation at imprinted regions. However, in our own study, we found very little evidence of enrichment for imprinted genes.

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can mediate these effects causing changes in gene expression leading to onset of obesity. Studies of genetic isolates have the potential to provide new epigenetic insights with advantages such as reduced genetic diversity and environmental exposures. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was an exploratory study of genome-wide DNA methylation in relation to body fat traits in 47 healthy adults from the genetic isolate of Norfolk Island. Quantitative body fat traits (body fat percentage, body mass index, hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-hip-ratio and weight) were carefully measured. DNA methylation data was obtained from peripheral blood using Illumina 450K arrays. Multi-trait analysis was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). CpG by trait association testing was performed using stepwise linear regressions. Two components were identified that explained approximately 89% of the phenotypic variance. In total, 5 differential methylated positions (DMPs) were identified at genome-wide significance (P≤ 2.4 × 10(-7)), which mapped to GOT2-CDH8, LYSMD3, HIBADH, ADGRD1 and EBF4 genes. Gene set enrichment analysis of 848 genes containing suggestive DMPs (P≤ 1.0 × 10(-4)) implicated the Cadherin (28 genes, P(adj) = 6.76 × 10(-7)) and Wnt signaling pathways (38 genes, P(adj) = 7.78 × 10(-6)).

METHODS: In a nested case-control study, we measured blood leukocyte DNA methylation levels in pre-diagnostic samples collected from 430 participants (208 cases; 222 controls) in the 1989 CLUE II cohort. We compared DNA methylation levels with case/control status to identify novel genomic regions, both single CpG sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), while controlling for known DNA methylation changes associated with smoking using a previously described pack-years-based smoking methylation score. Stratification analyses were conducted over time from blood draw to diagnosis, histology, and smoking status. RESULTS: We identified 16 single CpG sites and 40 DMRs significantly associated with lung cancer risk (q < 0.05).

METHODS: DNA methylation profiles (Illumina Infinium(®) HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) from 1941 individuals from four population-based European cohorts were analysed in relation to body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip and waist-height ratio within a meta-analytical framework. In a subset of these individuals, data on genome-wide gene expression level, biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism were also available. Validation of methylation markers associated with all adiposity measures was performed in 358 individuals. Finally, we investigated the association of obesity-related methylation marks with breast, colorectal cancer and myocardial infarction within relevant subsets of the discovery population. RESULTS: We identified 40 CpG loci with methylation levels associated with at least one adiposity measure. Of these, one CpG locus (cg06500161) in ABCG1 was associated with all four adiposity measures (P = 9.07×10(-)(8) to 3.27×10(-18)) and lower transcriptional activity of the full-length isoform of ABCG1 (P = 6.00×10(-7)), higher triglyceride levels (P = 5.37×10(-)(9)) and higher triglycerides-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (P = 1.03×10(-10)). Of the 40 informative and obesity-related CpG loci, two (in IL2RB and FGF18) were significantly associated with colorectal cancer (inversely, P < 1.6×10(-3)) and one intergenic locus on chromosome 1 was inversely associated with myocardial infarction (P < 1.25×10(-3)), independently of obesity and established risk factors.

Finally, our results revealed the mediation effect of cg03636183 (F2RL3), cg06096336 (PSMD1), cg13708645 (KDM2B), and cg17287155 (AHRR) within the association between smoking and LRRN3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that smoking-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression are associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors.

Although high heritability has been estimated, the identified genetic variants by genetic association studies only explain a small proportion of BMI variation. As an active effort for further exploring the molecular basis of BMI variation, large-scale epigenome-wide association studies have been conducted but with limited number of loci reported, perhaps due to poorly controlled confounding factors, including genetic factors. Being genetically identical, monozygotic twins discordant for BMI are ideal subjects for analyzing the epigenetic association between DNA methylation and BMI, providing perfect control on their genetic makeups largely responsible for BMI variation. SUBJECTS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study on BMI using 30 identical twin pairs (15 male and 15 female pairs) with age ranging from 39 to 72 years and degree of BMI discordance ranging from 3-7.5 kg/m(2). Methylation data from whole blood samples were collected using the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing technique. RESULTS: After adjusting for blood cell composition and clinical variables, we identified 136 CpGs with p-value < 1e-4, 30 CpGs with p < 1e-05 but no CpGs reached genome-wide significance. Genomic region-based analysis found 11 differentially methylated regions harboring coding and non-coding genes some of which were validated by gene expression analysis on independent samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our DNA methylation sequencing analysis on identical twins provides new references for the epigenetic regulation on BMI and obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat",10.1038/s41366-019-0382-4,"Adult;Aged;*Body Mass Index;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics;Epigenome/*genetics;Epigenomics;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Obesity/genetics;Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Twins;Body Mass Index",31152155,

DNA methylation was measured in baseline peripheral blood samples for 5,044 participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. For 1,032 participants, these measures were repeated using blood samples collected at follow-up, a median of 11 years later. A cross-sectional analysis of the association between smoking and DNA methylation and a longitudinal analysis of changes in smoking status and changes in DNA methylation were conducted. We used our cross-sectional analysis to replicate previously reported associations for current (N = 3,327) and former (N = 172) smoking. A comprehensive smoking index accounting for the biological half-life of smoking compounds and several aspects of smoking history was constructed to assess the reversibility of smoking-induced methylation changes. This measure of lifetime exposure to smoking allowed us to detect more associations than comparing current with never smokers. We identified 4,496 cross-sectional associations at P < 10(-7), including 3,296 annotated to 1,326 genes that were not previously implicated in smoking-associated DNA methylation changes at this significance threshold. We replicated the majority of previously reported associations (P < 10(-7)) for current and former smokers. In our data, we observed for former smokers a substantial degree of return to the methylation levels of never smokers, compared with current smokers (median: 74%, IQR = 63-86%), corresponding to small values (median: 2.75, IQR = 1.5-5.25) for the half-life parameter of the comprehensive smoking index. Longitudinal analyses identified 368 sites at which methylation changed upon smoking cessation. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of the comprehensive smoking index to detect associations between smoking and DNA methylation at CpGs across the genome, replicates the vast majority of previously reported associations, and quantifies the reversibility of smoking-induced methylation changes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1080/15592294.2019.1668739,Adult;Aged;CpG Islands;DNA/blood/genetics;*DNA Methylation;*Epigenome;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Smoking/epidemiology/*genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Methylation,31552803,PMC7153547

Methylation data on continental African ancestries are currently scarce, even though there are known genetic and epigenetic differences between ancestral groups and a high burden of NCDs in Africans. Furthermore, the degree to which current literature can be extrapolated to the understudied African populations, who have limited resources to conduct independent large-scale analysis, is not yet known. To this end, this study examines the reproducibility of previously published epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation conducted in different ethinicities, on factors related to NCDs, by replicating findings in 120 South African Batswana men aged 45 to 88 years. In addition, novel associations between methylation and NCD-related factors are investigated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. RESULTS: Up to 86% of previously identified epigenome-wide associations with NCD-related traits (alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, C-reactive protein, blood lipids and age) overlapped with those observed here and a further 13% were directionally consistent. Only 1% of the replicated associations presented with effects opposite to findings in other ancestral groups. The majority of these inconcistencies were associated with population-specific genomic variance. In addition, we identified eight new 450K array CpG associations not previously reported in other ancestries, and 11 novel EPIC CpG associations with alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The successful replication of existing EWAS findings in this African population demonstrates that blood-based 450K EWAS findings from commonly investigated ancestries can largely be extrapolated to ethnicities for which epigenetic data are not yet available. Possible population-specific differences in 14% of the tested associations do, however, motivate the need to include a diversity of ethnic groups in future epigenetic research. The novel associations found with the enhanced coverage of the Illumina EPIC array support its usefulness to expand epigenetic literature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-019-0805-z,Age Factors;Aged;Alcohol Drinking/genetics;Black People/*genetics;Body Mass Index;C-Reactive Protein/analysis/genetics;Cost of Illness;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Epigenome/*genetics;Humans;Lipids/blood/genetics;Male;Middle Aged;Noncommunicable Diseases/economics/*ethnology;Reproducibility of Results;Smoking/genetics;South Africa/ethnology;Waist Circumference/genetics;African Continental Ancestry Group,31910897,PMC6948000

Gene pathway enrichment analyses were further conducted. There were significant differences in DNA methylation between WTC-exposed breast cancer cases and unexposed prediagnostic breast cancer cases. The top differentially methylated genes were Intraflagellar Transport 74 (IFT74), WD repeat-containing protein 90 (WDR90), and Oncomodulin (OCM), which are commonly upregulated in tumors. Probes associated with established tumor suppressor genes (ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, and TP53) were hypermethylated among WTC-exposed breast cancer cases compared to the unexposed group. When comparing WTC EHC breast cancer cases vs. cancer-free controls, there appeared to be global hypomethylation among WTC-exposed breast cancer cases compared to exposed controls. Functional pathway analysis revealed enrichment of several gene pathways in WTC-exposed breast cancer cases including endocytosis, proteoglycans in cancer, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, focal adhesion, calcium signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, mTOR, Hippo, and oxytocin signaling.

Severity of these symptoms strongly impacts individual's quality of life and is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. One of the molecular mechanisms allowing for an interplay between these factors is DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification playing a pivotal role in regulation of brain functioning across lifespan. The aim of this study was to investigate if there are DNA methylation signatures associated with depression symptomatology in order to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to pathophysiology of depression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of continuous depression symptomatology score measured in a cohort of 724 monozygotic Danish twins (346 males, 378 females). Through EWAS analyses adjusted for sex, age, flow-cytometry based blood cell composition, and twin relatedness structure in the data we identified depression symptomatology score to be associated with blood DNA methylation levels in promoter regions of neuropsin (KLK8, p-value = 4.7 × 10(-7)) and DAZ associated protein 2 (DAZAP2, p-value = 3.13 × 10(-8)) genes. Other top associated probes were located in gene bodies of MAD1L1 (p-value = 5.16 × 10(-6)), SLC29A2 (p-value = 6.15 × 10(-6)) and AKT1 (p-value = 4.47 × 10(-6)), all genes associated before with development of depression. Additionally, the following three measures (a) DNAmAge (calculated with Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clock estimators) adjusted for chronological age, (b) difference between DNAmAge and chronological age, and (c) DNAmAge acceleration were not associated with depression symptomatology score in our cohort. In conclusion, our data suggests that depression symptomatology score is associated with DNA methylation levels of genes implicated in response to stress, depressive-like behaviors, and recurrent depression in patients, but not with global DNA methylation changes across the genome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1038/s41398-019-0548-9,"Aged;DNA Methylation;Denmark;Depression/*genetics;*Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenome;Female;Gene-Environment Interaction;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Quality of Life;Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics;Twins",31477683,PMC6718679

Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. METHODS: Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17 years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7 years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. CONCLUSION: The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor. Future epigenome-wide association studies may benefit from further examining associations between early DNA methylation and later health outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,body fat",10.1186/s13148-020-00841-5,"Adolescent;Adult;Body Mass Index;Child;Cohort Studies;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry;Male;Maternal Age;Mendelian Randomization Analysis;Middle Aged;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods;Pregnancy;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Biological Markers;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",32228717,PMC7106582

DESIGN: The discovery cohort consisted of 4355 women from the WHI. The replication cohort consisted of 571 mono- and dizygotic twins from the TwinsUK cohort. DNA methylation was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. Diet quality was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010).

Statistical significance was defined as a false discovery rate < 0.05. Significant sites were tested for replication in the TwinsUK cohort, with significant replication defined by P < 0.05 and a consistent direction. RESULTS: Diet quality was significantly associated with differential DNA methylation at 428 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in the discovery cohort.

We quantified neonatal methylomic variation in 1263 infants using DNA isolated from a unique collection of archived blood spots taken shortly after birth (mean = 6.08 days; s.d. = 3.24 days).

Our EWAS of maternal smoking during pregnancy identified 110 DMPs in neonatal blood, replicating previously reported genomic loci, including AHRR. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation mediates the relationship between maternal smoking and lower birth weight, finding evidence that methylomic variation at three DMPs may link exposure to outcome.

We investigated the relationships of methylation markers with both cotinine, an established marker of internal smoking exposure, and self-reported smoking. METHODS: Blood DNA methylation levels across the genome and serum cotinine were measured in 1000 older adults aged 50-75 years. Epigenome-wide scans were performed to identify methylation markers associated with cotinine. The inter-dose-response relationships between the number of cigarettes smoked per day, cotinine concentration, and DNA methylation were modeled by restricted cubic spline regression. RESULTS: Of 61 CpGs that passed the genome-wide significance threshold (p<1.13×10(-7)), 40 CpGs in 25 chromosomal regions were successfully replicated, showing 0.2-3% demethylation per 10ng/ml increases in cotinine. The strongest associations were observed for several loci at AHRR, F2RL3, 2q37.1, 6p21.33, and GFI1 that were previously identified to be related to self-reported smoking. One locus at RAB34 was newly discovered. Both cotinine and methylation markers exhibited non-linear relationships with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, where the highest rates of increase in cotinine and decreases in methylation were observed at low smoking intensity (1-15 cigarettes/day) and plateaued at high smoking intensity (>15-20 cigarettes/day). A clear linear relationship was observed between cotinine concentration and methylation level. Both cotinine and methylation markers showed similar accuracy in distinguishing current from never smoker, but only methylation markers distinguished former from never smoker with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study corroborates and expands the list of smoking-associated DNA methylation markers.

An increasingly recognised need for large-scale, longitudinally-profiled samples collected world-wide has made the development of efficient and straightforward sample collection and storage procedures a pressing issue. An alternative to the low-temperature storage of EDTA tubes of venous blood samples, which are frequently the source of the DNA used in such studies, is to collect and store at room temperature blood samples using purpose built filter paper, such as Whatman FTA® cards. Our goal was to determine whether DNA stored in this manner can be used to generate DNA methylation profiles comparable to those generated using blood samples frozen in EDTA tubes. Methods: DNA methylation profiles were obtained from matched EDTA tube and Whatman FTA® card whole-blood samples from 62 Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study participants using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Multiple quality control procedures were implemented, the relationship between the two sample types assessed, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) performed for smoking status, age and the interaction between these variables and sample storage method. Results: Dried blood spot (DBS) DNA methylation profiles were of good quality and DNA methylation profiles from matched DBS and EDTA tube samples were highly correlated (mean r = 0.991) and could distinguish between participants. EWASs replicated established associations for smoking and age, with no evidence for moderation by storage method. Conclusions: Our results support the use of Whatman FTA® cards for collecting and storing blood samples for DNA methylation profiling. This approach is likely to be particularly beneficial for large-scale studies and those carried out in areas where freezer access is limited. Furthermore, our results will inform consideration of the use of newborn heel prick DBSs for research use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15136.1,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,30984878,PMC6446498

As the most-studied epigenetic modification, DNA methylation is strongly associated with smoking exposure, providing a potential mechanism that links smoking to adverse health outcomes. Here, we reviewed the reversibility of DNA methylation in accessible peripheral tissues, mainly blood, in relation to cigarette smoking cessation and the utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker signature to differentiate current, former, and never smokers and to quantify time since cessation. We summarized thousands of differentially methylated Cytosine-Guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and regions associated with smoking cessation from candidate gene and epigenome-wide association studies, as well as the prediction accuracy of the multi-CpG predictors for smoking status. Overall, there is robust evidence for DNA methylation signature of cigarette smoking cessation. However, there are still gaps to fill, including (1) cell-type heterogeneity in measuring blood DNA methylation; (2) underrepresentation of non-European ancestry populations; (3) limited longitudinal data to quantitatively measure DNA methylation after smoking cessation over time; and (4) limited data to study the impact of smoking cessation on other epigenetic features, noncoding RNAs, and histone modifications. Epigenetic machinery provides promising biomarkers that can improve success in smoking cessation in the clinical setting. To achieve this goal, larger and more-diverse samples with longitudinal measures of a broader spectrum of epigenetic marks will be essential to developing a robust DNA methylation biomarker assay, followed by meeting validation requirements for the assay before being implemented as a clinically useful tool.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Is review",10.1016/j.addicn.2023.100079,Biological Markers;Smoke;Smoking Cessation;Smoking;Epigenomics,37123087,PMC10136056

Epigenetic alterations may functionally link EDCs with gene expression and metabolic traits. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate metabolic-related effects of the exposure to endocrine disruptors including five parabens, three bisphenols, and 13 metabolites of nine phthalates as measured in 24-hour urine on epigenome-wide DNA methylation. METHODS: A blood-based epigenome-wide association study was performed in 622 participants from the Lifelines DEEP cohort using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 methylation data and EDC excretions in 24-hour urine. Out of the 21 EDCs, 13 compounds were detected in >75% of the samples and, together with bisphenol F, were included in these analyses. Furthermore, we explored the putative function of identified methylation markers and their correlations with metabolic traits. RESULTS: We found 20 differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) associated with 10 EDCs at suggestive p-value < 1 × 10(-6), of which four, associated with MEHP and MEHHP, were genome-wide significant (Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 1.19 × 10(-7)). Nine out of 20 CpGs were significantly associated with at least one of the tested metabolic traits, such as fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, blood lipids, and/or blood pressure. 18 out of 20 EDC-associated CpGs were annotated to genes functionally related to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and glycemic traits. CONCLUSIONS: The identified DNA methylation markers for exposure to the most common EDCs provide suggestive mechanism underlying the contributions of EDCs to metabolic health.

DNA methylation (DNAm) may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Toenail metals are non-invasive biomarkers, reflecting a medium-term time exposure window. OBJECTIVES: This study examined variation in leukocyte DNAm and toenail arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), and mercury (Hg) among elderly men in the Normative Aging Study, a longitudinal cohort. METHODS: We repeatedly collected samples of blood and toenail clippings. We measured DNAm in leukocytes with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 K BeadChip. We first performed median regression to evaluate the effects of each individual toenail metal on DNAm at three levels: individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, regions, and pathways. Then, we applied a Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to assess the joint and individual effects of metal mixtures on DNAm. Significant CpGs were identified using a multiple testing correction based on the independent degrees of freedom approach for correlated outcomes. The approach considers the effective degrees of freedom in the DNAm data using the principal components that explain >95% variation of the data. RESULTS: We included 564 subjects (754 visits) between 1999 and 2013. The numbers of significantly differentially methylated CpG sites, regions, and pathways varied by metals. For example, we found six significant pathways for As, three for Cd, and one for Mn. The As-associated pathways were associated with cancer (e.g., skin cancer) and cardiovascular disease, whereas the Cd-associated pathways were related to lung cancer. Metal mixtures were also associated with 47 significant CpG sites, as well as pathways, mainly related to cancer and cardiovascular disease.

However, their results were inconsistent. Longitudinal observations on the temporal relationship between DNA methylation and BP are lacking. METHODS: A candidate CpG site association study for BP was conducted on 1072 twins in the Chinese National Twin Registry. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for candidate CpG sites. Cross-lagged models were used to assess the temporal relationship between BP and DNA methylation in 308 twins who completed 2 surveys in 2013 and 2018. Then, the significant cross-lagged associations were validated by adopting the Inference About Causation From Examination of Familial Confounding approach. Finally, to evaluate the cumulative effects of DNA methylation on the progression of hypertension, we established methylation risk scores based on BP-associated CpG sites and performed Markov multistate models. RESULTS: 16 and 20 CpG sites were validated to be associated with systolic BP and diastolic BP, respectively. In the cross-lagged analysis, we detected that methylation of 2 CpG sites could predict subsequent systolic BP, and systolic BP predicted methylation at another 3 CpG sites. For diastolic BP, methylation at 3 CpG sites had significant cross-lagged effects for predicting diastolic BP levels, while the prediction from the opposite direction was observed at one site. Among these, 3 associations were validated in the Inference About Causation From Examination of Familial Confounding analysis.

METHODS: We conducted a methylome-wide association study among twelve cohort- and race/ethnicity-stratified subpopulations from the Women's Health Initiative and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 8397; mean age: 61.5 years; 83% female; 45% African American; 9% Hispanic/Latino American). We averaged geocoded address-specific estimates of daily and monthly mean PM concentrations over 2, 7, 28, and 365 days and 1 and 12 months before exams at which we measured leukocyte DNAm in whole blood. We estimated subpopulation-specific, DNAm-PM associations at approximately 485,000 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites in multi-level, linear, mixed-effects models. We combined subpopulation- and site-specific estimates in fixed-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses, then for associations that exceeded methylome-wide significance and were not heterogeneous across subpopulations (P < 1.0 × 10(-7); P(Cochran's Q) > 0.10), we characterized associations using publicly accessible genomic databases and attempted replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study. RESULTS: Analyses identified significant DNAm-PM associations at three CpG sites. Twenty-eight-day mean PM(10) was positively associated with DNAm at cg19004594 (chromosome 20; MATN4; P = 3.33 × 10(-8)). One-month mean PM(10) and PM(2.5-10) were positively associated with DNAm at cg24102420 (chromosome 10; ARPP21; P = 5.84 × 10(-8)) and inversely associated with DNAm at cg12124767 (chromosome 7; CFTR; P = 9.86 × 10(-8)). The PM-sensitive CpG sites mapped to neurological, pulmonary, endocrine, and cardiovascular disease-related genes, but DNAm at those sites was not associated with gene expression in blood cells and did not replicate in KORA.

We aimed to evaluate the associations between long-term exposure to wildfire-related PM(2.5) and blood DNA methylation, and whether the associations differ from those with non-wildfire-related PM(2.5). METHODS: We studied 479 Australian women comprising 132 twin pairs and 215 of their sisters. Blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Data on 3-year (year of blood collection and previous two years) average wildfire-related and non-wildfire-related PM(2.5) at 0.01°×0.01° spatial resolution were created by combining information from satellite observations, chemical transport models, and ground-based observations. Exposure data were linked to each participant's home address, assuming the address did not change during the exposure window. For DNA methylation of each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), and for global DNA methylation represented by the average of all measured CpGs or CpGs in repetitive elements, we evaluated their associations with wildfire- or non-wildfire-related PM(2.5) using a within-sibship analysis controlling for factors shared between siblings and other important covariates. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined by comb-p and DMRcate. RESULTS: The 3-year average wildfire-related PM(2.5) (range: 0.3 to 7.6 µg/m(3)(,) mean: 1.6 µg/m(3)) was negatively, but not significantly (p-values greater than 0.05) associated with all seven global DNA methylation measures. There were 26 CpGs and 33 DMRs associated with wildfire-related PM(2.5) (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05) mapped to 47 genes enriched for pathways related to inflammatory regulation and platelet activation. These genes have been related to many human diseases or phenotypes e.g., cancer, mental disorders, diabetes, obesity, asthma, blood pressure. These CpGs, DMRs and enriched pathways did not overlap with the 1 CpG and 7 DMRs associated with non-wildfire-related PM(2.5).

In a recent meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and DNA methylation at several genomic sites were identified in blood from newborns and children. While EWASs reveal human-relevant associations, experimental studies are required to validate the relationship between exposure and DNA methylation changes, and to assess if such changes have implications for gene expression. Herein, we studied DNA methylation and gene expression of five of the top genes identified in the EWAS meta-analysis, MED31, MRPL19, GGH, GRK1, and LYSMD3, upon MeHg exposure in human SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 8 or 40 nM of MeHg during differentiation, using bisulfite-pyrosequencing and qPCR, respectively. The concentrations were selected to cover the range of MeHg concentrations in cord blood (2-8.5 μg/L) observed in the cohorts included in the EWAS. Exposure to MeHg increased DNA methylation at MED31, a transcriptional regulator essential for fetal development. The results were in concordance with the epidemiological findings where more MED31 methylation was associated with higher concentrations of MeHg. Additionally, we found a non-significant decrease in DNA methylation at GGH, which corresponds to the direction of change observed in the EWAS, and a significant correlation of GGH methylation with its expression. In conclusion, this study corroborates some of the EWAS findings and puts forward candidate genes involved in MeHg's effects on the developing brain, thus highlighting the value of experimental validation of epidemiological association studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No EWAS",10.3389/fgene.2022.993387,"DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",36176303,PMC9513252

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether childhood neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with differences in DNA methylation by age 18 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of children born between 1994 and 1995 in England and Wales and followed up from age 5 to 18 years. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2019. EXPOSURES: High-resolution neighborhood data (indexing deprivation, dilapidation, disconnection, and dangerousness) collected across childhood. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: DNA methylation in whole blood was drawn at age 18 years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and methylation were tested using 3 prespecified approaches: (1) testing probes annotated to candidate genes involved in biological responses to growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and investigated in previous epigenetic research (stress reactivity-related and inflammation-related genes), (2) polyepigenetic scores indexing differential methylation in phenotypes associated with growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods (obesity, inflammation, and smoking), and (3) a theory-free epigenome-wide association study. RESULTS: A total of 1619 participants (806 female individuals [50%]) had complete neighborhood and DNA methylation data. Children raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibited differential DNA methylation in genes involved in inflammation (β = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P < .001) and smoking (β = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11-0.25; P < .001) but not obesity (β = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11; P = .12). An epigenome-wide association study identified multiple CpG sites at an arraywide significance level of P < 1.16 × 10-7 in genes involved in the metabolism of hydrocarbons. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and methylation were small but robust to family-level socioeconomic factors and to individual-level tobacco smoking. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children raised in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods appeared to enter young adulthood epigenetically distinct from their less disadvantaged peers. This finding suggests that epigenetic regulation may be a mechanism by which the childhood neighborhood environment alters adult health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: neighborhood disadvantage | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.6095,"Adolescent;Air Pollutants/toxicity;Child;Child, Preschool;DNA/*blood;DNA Methylation/*genetics;England/epidemiology;Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics;Female;Humans;Inflammation/genetics;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Obesity/genetics/metabolism;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Phenotype;Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data;Smoking/genetics;Socioeconomic Factors;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Methylation;DNA",32478847,PMC7265095

The sample included 150 Caucasian monozygotic twins between the ages of 15 and 20 (73% female; Mage = 17.52 SD = 1.28) who were assessed during a developmental stage characterized by relatively distinct neurophysiological changes. All twins were generally healthy and currently free of medications with psychotropic effects. DNAm was measured in peripheral blood cells using the Infinium Human BeadChip 450 K Array. MD associations with early-onset MD were detected at 760 differentially and variably methylated probes/regions that mapped to 428 genes. Genes and genomic regions involved neural circuitry formation, projection, functioning, and plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses implicated genes related to neuron structures and neurodevelopmental processes including cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., PCDHA genes). Genes previously implicated in mood and psychiatric disorders as well as chronic stress (e.g., NRG3) also were identified. DNAm regions associated with early-onset MD were found to overlap genetic loci identified in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analysis of depression.

Numerous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have investigated the associations of DNA methylation at single CpG sites with childhood outcomes. However, the overall contribution of DNA methylation across the genome (R(2)(Methylation)) towards childhood phenotypes is unknown. An estimate of R(2)(Methylation) would provide context regarding the importance of DNA methylation explaining variance in health outcomes. We therefore estimated the variance explained by epigenome-wide cord blood methylation (R(2)(Methylation)) for five childhood phenotypes: gestational age, birth weight, and body mass index (BMI), IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age. We adapted a genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) approach with cross-validation (CV) to DNA methylation data and applied it in two population-based birth cohorts: ALSPAC (n = 775) and Generation R (n = 1382). RESULTS: Using information from > 470,000 autosomal probes we estimated that DNA methylation at birth explains 32% (SD(CV) = 0.06) of gestational age variance and 5% (SD(CV) = 0.02) of birth weight variance. The R(2)(Methylation) estimates for BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age estimates were near 0% across almost all cross-validation iterations. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cord blood methylation explains a moderate degree of variance in gestational age and birth weight, in line with the success of previous EWAS in identifying numerous CpG sites associated with these phenotypes. In contrast, we could not obtain a reliable estimate for school-age BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms. This may reflect a null bias due to insufficient sample size to detect variance explained in more weakly associated phenotypes, although the true R(2)(Methylation) for these phenotypes is likely below that of gestational age and birth weight when using DNA methylation at birth.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: cord blood",10.1186/s13148-022-01268-w,"Birth Weight/genetics;CpG Islands;DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenome;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;*Individuality;Phenotype;Epigenomics",35440009,PMC9020033

DNA methylation is one of the most well-known molecular determinants of the epigenetic status of cells. Blood DNA methylation has been proven sensitive to air pollutants, but the molecular impact of air pollution on new-borns has so far received little attention. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), particulate matter (PM(10)), temperature and humidity during pregnancy are associated with differences in placental DNA methylation levels. METHODS: Whole-genome DNA-methylation was measured using the Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the placenta of 668 newborns from the EDEN cohort. We designed an original strategy using a priori biological information to focus on candidate genes with a specific expression pattern in placenta (active or silent) combined with an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We used robust linear regression to identify CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with each exposure during short- and long-term time-windows. RESULTS: The candidate genes approach identified nine CpGs mapping to 9 genes associated with prenatal NO(2) and PM(10) exposure [false discovery rate (FDR) p < 0.05]. Among these, the methylation level of 2 CpGs located in ADORA2B remained significantly associated with NO(2) exposure during the 2nd trimester and whole pregnancy in the EWAS (FDR p < 0.05). EWAS further revealed associations between the environmental exposures under study and variations of DNA methylation of 4 other CpGs. We further identified 27 DMRs significantly (FDR p < 0.05) associated with air pollutants exposure and 13 DMRs with meteorological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The methylation of ADORA2B, a gene whose expression was previously associated with hypoxia and pre-eclampsia, was consistently found here sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. In addition, air pollutants were associated to DMRs pointing towards genes previously implicated in preeclampsia, hypertensive and metabolic disorders. These findings demonstrate that air pollutants exposure at levels commonly experienced in the European population are associated with placental gene methylation and provide some mechanistic insight into some of the reported effects of air pollutants on preeclampsia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No Blood samples",10.1016/j.envint.2018.05.007,"Air Pollutants/*analysis;*Air Pollution/analysis/statistics & numerical data;Cohort Studies;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Female;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Maternal Exposure/*statistics & numerical data;Placenta/*chemistry;Pregnancy;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase",29935799,

For our study that evaluated blood and CSF taken from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients, we developed a protocol to clean and quality-check genome-wide methylation levels and compared the methylomic profiles of the two tissues to determine whether blood is a suitable surrogate for CSF. CSF samples were collected from 279 aSAH patients longitudinally during the first 14 days of hospitalization, and a subset of 88 of these patients also provided blood samples within the first 2 days. Quality control (QC) procedures included identification and exclusion of poor performing samples and low-quality probes, functional normalization, and correction for cell-type heterogeneity via surrogate variable analysis (SVA). Significant differences in rates of poor sample performance was observed between blood (1.1% failing QC) and CSF (9.12% failing QC; p = 0.003). Functional normalization increased the concordance of methylation values among technical replicates in both CSF and blood. SVA improved the asymptotic behavior of the test of association in a simulated EWAS under the null hypothesis. To determine the suitability of blood as a surrogate for CSF, we calculated the correlations of adjusted methylation values at each CpG between blood and CSF globally and by genomic regions. Overall, mean within-CpG correlation was low (r < 0.26), suggesting that blood is not a suitable surrogate for global methylation in CSF. However, differences in the magnitude of the correlation were observed by genomic region (CpG island, shore, shelf, open sea; p < 0.001 for all) and orientation with respect to nearby genes (3' UTR, transcription start site, exon, body, 5' UTR; p < 0.01 for all).

First, we conducted a meta-analysis and follow-up pathway analyses. Second, we used novel region discovery methods [i.e., differentially methylated regions (DMRs) analyses]. To this end, we used data from two independent population-based studies, the Generation R Study (n = 912) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n = 828), to (i) measure genome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood and (ii) extract a prenatal maternal stress composite.

Follow-up analyses of the top hits derived from our epigenome-wide meta-analysis (meta P <1.00e-04) indicated an over-representation of the methyltransferase activity pathway.

This study investigated DNA methylation in cord blood to identify possible ""at birth"" signatures that may indicate susceptibility to behavioral problems at 18 months of age. Cord blood was collected from 256 children of mothers who had self-reported on symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the behavior of their child at 18 months of age. Whole genome DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina MethylationEPIC assay. The mother and child pairs were categorized into four groups, based on both self-reported depressive symptoms, PND or Healthy control (HC), and scores from the Child Behavior checklist (high or low for internalizing, externalizing, and total scores). Adjustments were made for batch effects, cell-type, and clinical covariates. Differentially methylated sites were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered significant. The analysis was also stratified by sex of the child. Among boys, we observed higher and correlated DNA methylation of one CpG-site in the promoter region of TPP1 in the HC group, with high externalizing scores compared to HC with low externalizing scores. Boys in the PND group showed lower DNA methylation in NUDT15 among those with high, compared to low, internalizing scores; the DNA methylation levels of CpGs in this gene were positively correlated with the CBCL scores. Hence, the differentially methylated CpG sites could be of interest for resilience, regardless of maternal mental health during pregnancy. The findings are in a relatively healthy study cohort, thus limiting the possibility of detecting strong effects associated with behavioral difficulties. This is the first investigation of cord blood DNA methylation signs of fetal programming of PND on child behavior at 18 months of age and thus calls for independent replications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1038/s41398-022-01954-6,"Child, Preschool;DNA Methylation;Depression/genetics;*Epigenome;Female;Fetal Blood/metabolism;Humans;Male;Mothers/psychology;Pregnancy;*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/genetics/metabolism;Fetal Blood;Umbilical Cord",35513368,PMC9072531

Epigenomic analyses have been limited and mainly focused on occupational chromium exposure; their findings are not generalizable to populations with environmental Cr exposure. Methods: We identified the differential methylation of genes and regions to elucidate the mechanisms of toxicity related to environmental chromium exposure. DNA methylation was measured in blood samples collected from individuals in Cr-contaminated (n = 10) and unexposed areas (n = 10) by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation850K array. To evaluate the relationship between chromium levels in urine and CpG methylation at 850 thousand sites, we investigated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by using linear models and DMRcate method, respectively. The model was adjusted for biologically relevant variables and estimated cell-type compositions. Results: At the epigenome-wide level, we identified five CpGs [cg20690919 (p (FDR =)0.006), cg00704664 (p (FDR =)0.024), cg10809143 (p (FDR =)0.043), cg27057652 (p (FDR =)0.047), cg05390480 (p (FDR =)0.024)] and one DMR (chr17: 19,648,718-19,648,972), annotated to ALDH3A1 genes (p < 0.05) as being significantly associated with log(2) transformed urinary chromium levels. Discussion: Environmental chromium exposure is associated with DNA methylation, and the significant DMPs and DMR being annotated to cause DNA damage and genomic instability were found in this work.

We aimed to identify CpG sites at which DNA methylation levels are associated with blood levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and total cholesterol in 725 participants of the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. Subsequently, we sought replication in a non-overlapping set of 760 participants. RESULTS: Genome-wide methylation levels were measured in whole blood using the Illumina Methylation 450 array. Associations between lipid levels and DNA methylation beta values were examined using linear mixed-effect models. All models were adjusted for sex, age, smoking, white blood cell proportions, array number, and position on array. A Bonferroni-corrected p value lower than 1.08 × 10(-7) was considered statistically significant. Five CpG sites annotated to genes including DHCR24, CPT1A, ABCG1, and SREBF1 were identified and replicated. Four CpG sites were associated with triglycerides, including CpG sites annotated to CPT1A (cg00574958 and cg17058475), ABCG1 (cg06500161), and SREBF1 (cg11024682). Two CpG sites were associated with HDL-C, including ABCG1 (cg06500161) and DHCR24 (cg17901584). No significant associations were observed with LDL-C or total cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: We report an association of HDL-C levels with methylation of a CpG site near DHCR24, a protein-coding gene involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, which has previously been reported to be associated with other metabolic traits. Furthermore, we confirmed previously reported associations of methylation of CpG sites within CPT1A, ABCG1, and SREBF1 and lipids.

The main objective is to simultaneously describe DNA methylation patterns associated with DR-TLE in hippocampus, amygdala, surrounding cortex to the epileptogenic zone (SCEZ), and peripheral blood. An Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array was performed in 19 DR-TLE patients and 10 postmortem non-epileptic controls. Overall, 32, 59, and 3210 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with DR-TLE in the hippocampus, amygdala, and SCEZ, respectively. These DMP-affected genes were involved in neurotrophic and calcium signaling in the hippocampus and voltage-gated channels in SCEZ, among others. One of the hippocampus DMPs (cg26834418 (CHORDC1)) showed a strong blood-brain correlation with BECon and IMAGE-CpG, suggesting that it could be a potential surrogate peripheral biomarker of DR-TLE. Moreover, in three of the top SCEZ's DMPs (SHANK3, SBF1, and MCF2L), methylation status was verified with methylation-specific qPCR. The differentially methylated CpGs were classified in DMRs: 2 in the hippocampus, 12 in the amygdala, and 531 in the SCEZ. We identified genes that had not been associated to DR-TLE so far such as TBX5, EXOC7, and WRHN. The area with more DMPs associated with DR-TLE was the SCEZ, some of them related to voltage-gated channels. The DMPs found in the amygdala were involved in inflammatory processes.

METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on 611 adults free of diagnosed disease, living in Italy and Sweden, in whom we also measured plasma concentrations of 6 PCB congeners, DDE and hexachlorobenzene. RESULTS: We identified 650 CpG sites whose methylation correlates strongly (FDR < 0.01) with plasma concentrations of at least one PCB congener. Stronger effects were observed in males and in Sweden. This epigenetic exposure profile shows extensive and highly statistically significant overlaps with published profiles associated with the risk of future B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as with clinical CLL (38 and 28 CpG sites, respectively). For all these sites, the methylation changes were in the same direction for increasing exposure and for higher disease risk or clinical disease status, suggesting an etiological link between exposure and CLL. Mediation analysis reinforced the suggestion of a causal link between exposure, changes in DNA methylation and disease. Disease connectivity analysis identified multiple additional diseases associated with differentially methylated genes, including melanoma for which an etiological link with PCB exposure is established, as well as developmental and neurological diseases for which there is corresponding epidemiological evidence. Differentially methylated genes include many homeobox genes, suggesting that PCBs target stem cells. Furthermore, numerous polycomb protein target genes were hypermethylated with increasing exposure, an effect known to constitute an early marker of carcinogenesis.

Increasing evidence supports that blood DNA methylation, the best studied epigenetic mark, is related to diabetes risk. Few prospective studies, however, are available. We studied the association of blood DNA methylation with diabetes in the Strong Heart Study. We used limma, Iterative Sure Independence Screening and Cox regression to study the association of blood DNA methylation with fasting glucose, HOMA-IR and incident type 2 diabetes among 1312 American Indians from the Strong Heart Study. DNA methylation was measured using Illumina's MethylationEPIC beadchip. We also assessed the biological relevance of our findings using bioinformatics analyses. RESULTS: Among the 358 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) that were cross-sectionally associated either with fasting glucose or HOMA-IR, 49 were prospectively associated with incident type 2 diabetes, although no DMPs remained significant after multiple comparisons correction. Multiple of the top DMPs were annotated to genes with relevant functions for diabetes including SREBF1, associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and insulin sensitivity; ABCG1, involved in cholesterol and phospholipids transport; and HDAC1, of the HDAC family. (HDAC inhibitors have been proposed as an emerging treatment for diabetes and its complications.) CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that differences in peripheral blood DNA methylation are related to cross-sectional markers of glucose metabolism and insulin activity. While some of these DMPs were modestly associated with prospective incident type 2 diabetes, they did not survive multiple testing.

ADHD and related personality traits, such as impulsivity and callousness, are caused by genetic and environmental factors and their interplay. Epigenetic modifications of DNA, including methylation, are thought to mediate between such factors and behavior and may behave as biomarkers for disorders. Here, we set out to study DNA methylation in persistent ADHD and related traits. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) on peripheral whole blood from participants in the NeuroIMAGE study (age range 12-23 years). We compared participants with persistent ADHD (n = 35) with healthy controls (n = 19) and with participants with remittent ADHD (n = 19). Additionally, we performed EWASs of impulsive and callous traits derived from the Conners Parent Rating Scale and the Callous-Unemotional Inventory, respectively, across all participants. For every EWAS, the linear regression model analyzed included covariates for age, sex, smoking scores, and surrogate variables reflecting blood cell type composition and genetic background. We observed no epigenome-wide significant differences in single CpG site methylation between participants with persistent ADHD and healthy controls or participants with remittent ADHD. However, epigenome-wide analysis of differentially methylated regions provided significant findings showing that hypermethylated regions in the APOB and LPAR5 genes were associated with ADHD persistence compared to ADHD remittance (p = 1.68 * 10(-24) and p = 9.06 * 10(-7), respectively); both genes are involved in cholesterol signaling. Both findings appeared to be linked to genetic variation in cis. We found neither significant epigenome-wide single CpG sites nor regions associated with impulsive and callous traits; the top-hits from these analyses were annotated to genes involved in neurotransmitter release and the regulation of the biological clock. No link to genetic variation was observed for these findings, which thus might reflect environmental influences. In conclusion, in this pilot study with a small sample size, we observed several DNA-methylation-disorder/trait associations of potential significance for ADHD and the related behavioral traits. Although we do not wish to draw conclusions before replication in larger, independent samples, cholesterol signaling and metabolism may be of relevance for the onset and/or persistence of ADHD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.3389/fgene.2020.00016,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Genome;Genomics;Methylation,32082368,PMC7005250

Here, blood-derived DNA methylation data (HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) collected prior to and following combat exposure in three cohorts of male military members were analyzed to assess whether DNA methylation profiles are associated with the development of PTSD. A total of 123 PTSD cases and 143 trauma-exposed controls were included in the analyses. The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) PTSD EWAS QC pipeline was used on all cohorts, and results were combined using a sample size weighted meta-analysis in a two-stage design. In stage one, we jointly analyzed data of two new cohorts (N = 126 and 78) for gene discovery, and sought to replicate significant findings in a third, previously published cohort (N = 62) to assess the robustness of our results. In stage 2, we aimed at maximizing power for gene discovery by combining all three cohorts in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Stage 1 analyses identified four CpG sites in which, conditional on pre-deployment DNA methylation, post-deployment DNA methylation was significantly associated with PTSD status after epigenome-wide adjustment for multiple comparisons. The most significant (intergenic) CpG cg05656210 (p = 1.0 × 10(-08)) was located on 5q31 and significantly replicated in the third cohort. In addition, 19 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified, but failed replication. Stage 2 analyses identified three epigenome-wide significant CpGs, the intergenic CpG cg05656210 and two additional CpGs located in MAD1L1 (cg12169700) and HEXDC (cg20756026). Interestingly, cg12169700 had an underlying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) which was located within the same LD block as a recently identified PTSD-associated SNP in MAD1L1. Stage 2 analyses further identified 12 significant differential methylated regions (DMRs), 1 of which was located in MAD1L1 and 4 were situated in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the development of combat-related PTSD is associated with distinct methylation patterns in several genomic positions and regions. Our most prominent findings suggest the involvement of the immune system through the HLA region and HEXDC, and MAD1L1 which was previously associated with PTSD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-019-0798-7,"Adult;Case-Control Studies;Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics;Cohort Studies;CpG Islands/*genetics;DNA Methylation/genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics;Epigenome/genetics;Genomics/methods;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Military Personnel/*psychology;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/ethnology/*genetics;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Military Personnel",31931860,PMC6958602

Alternatively, we identified 2, 1, and 14 differentially hydroxymethylated site(s) associated with maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placental Pb, respectively, with most showing increases in hydroxymethylation with exposure. Significantly overrepresented pathways amongst genes associated with differential methylation and hydroxymethylation (q < 0.10) included mechanisms pertaining to nervous system and organ development, calcium transport and regulation, and signalling activities. Our results suggest that both methylation and hydroxymethylation in the placenta can be variable based on Pb exposure and that the pathways impacted could affect placental function.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1080/15592294.2022.2126087,"Infant, Newborn;Infant;Humans;Female;Pregnancy;*DNA Methylation;*Placenta/metabolism;Lead/toxicity/metabolism;Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenomics;Maternal Exposure/adverse effects;Humanities;Humanism;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase",36148884,PMC9665158

Placental epigenetic mechanisms may underlie these associations. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify placental DNA methylation changes associated with maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and rate of gestational weight gain at first (GWG1), second (GWG2), and third trimester (GWG3). METHOD: Participants of the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies with genome-wide placental DNA methylation (n = 301) and gene expression (n = 75) data were included. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to test the associations of 1 kg/m(2) increase in prepregnancy BMI or 1 kg/week increase in GWG with DNA methylation levels. Genes harboring top differentially methylated CpGs (FDR P < 0.05) were evaluated for placental gene expression. We assessed whether DNA methylation sites known to be associated with BMI in child or adult tissues, were also associated with maternal prepregnancy BMI in placenta. RESULTS: Prepregnancy BMI was associated with DNA methylation at cg14568196[EGFL7], cg15339142[VETZ], and cg02301019[AC092377.1] (FDR P < 0.05, P ranging from 1.4 × 10(-10) to 1.7 × 10(-9)). GWG1 or GWG2 was associated with DNA methylation at cg17918270[MYT1L], cg20735365[DLX5], and cg17451688[SLC35F3] (FDR P < 0.05, P ranging from 6.4 × 10(-10) to 1.2 × 10(-8)). Both prepregnancy BMI and DNA methylation at cg1456819 [EGFL7] were negatively correlated with EGFL7 expression in placenta (P < 0.05). Several CpGs previously implicated in obesity traits in children and adults were associated with prepregnancy BMI in placenta. Functional annotations revealed that EGFL7 is highly expressed in placenta and the differentially methylated CpG sites near EGFL7 and VEZT were cis-meQTL targets in blood. CONCLUSIONS: We identified placental DNA methylation changes at novel loci associated with prepregnancy BMI and GWG. The overlap between CpGs associated with obesity traits in placenta and other tissues in children and adults suggests that epigenetic mechanisms in placenta may give insights to early origins of obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1038/s41366-020-0546-2,"Adult;*Body Mass Index;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;*Gestational Weight Gain;Humans;Obesity;Placenta/*metabolism;Pregnancy;Young Adult;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Weight Gain;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA",32071425,PMC7261634

Responders (n = 24) and non-responders (n = 24) were identified in a prior 3-year phylloquinone supplementation trial based on their changes in plasma phylloquinone concentrations. Differential DNA methylation was identified in multiple regions with previously unknown relationships to phylloquinone absorption and metabolism, such as at the TMEM263 locus. A hypothesis-driven analysis of lipid-related genes highlighted a site in the NPC1L1 gene, supplementing existing evidence for its role in phylloquinone absorption. Furthermore, an EWAS for baseline plasma phylloquinone concentrations revealed a strong correlation between the epigenomic signatures of phylloquinone baseline status and response to supplementation.

Methylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sequences in the DNA was assessed from blood samples collected at age 18 years (n = 369) in the F1 generation. We conducted an epigenome wide association study to examine CpGs related to the frequency of heavy vehicles passing by subjects' homes, and employed multiple linear regression models to assess potential associations. We repeated some of these analysis in the F2 generation (n = 140). Thirty-five CpG sites were associated with heavy vehicular traffic. After adjusting for confounders, we found 23 CpGs that were more methylated, and 11 CpGs that were less methylated with increasing heavy vehicular traffic frequency among all subjects. In the F2 generation, 2 of 31 CpGs were associated with traffic frequencies and the direction of the effect was the same as in the F1 subset while differential methylation of 7 of 31 CpG sites correlated with gene expression.

It is hypothesized that changes in offspring DNA methylation (DNAm) underline these associations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To address this hypothesis, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from eight birth cohorts investigating relationships between cord blood DNAm and fetal exposure to maternal glucose (Nmaximum = 3,503), insulin (Nmaximum = 2,062), and area under the curve of glucose (AUCgluc) following oral glucose tolerance tests (Nmaximum = 1,505). We performed lookup analyses for identified cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in independent observational cohorts to examine associations between DNAm and cardiometabolic traits as well as tissue-specific gene expression. RESULTS: Greater maternal AUCgluc was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at neighboring CpGs cg26974062 (β [SE] -0.013 [2.1 × 10-3], P value corrected for false discovery rate [PFDR] = 5.1 × 10-3) and cg02988288 (β [SE]-0.013 [2.3 × 10-3], PFDR = 0.031) in TXNIP. These associations were attenuated in women with GDM. Lower blood DNAm at these two CpGs near TXNIP was associated with multiple metabolic traits later in life, including type 2 diabetes. TXNIP DNAm in liver biopsies was associated with hepatic expression of TXNIP. We observed little evidence of associations between either maternal glucose or insulin and cord blood DNAm. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal hyperglycemia, as reflected by AUCgluc, was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at TXNIP. Associations between DNAm at these CpGs and metabolic traits in subsequent lookup analyses suggest that these may be candidate loci to investigate in future causal and mediation analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.2337/dc21-1701,"DNA Methylation/genetics;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism;*Diabetes, Gestational/genetics/metabolism;Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenome;Female;Fetal Blood/metabolism;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Pregnancy;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",35104326,PMC8918264

We examined the association between alcohol consumption and DNA methylation patterns using 3 approaches: a conventional epigenome-wide association study (EWAS); a co-twin comparison design, which controls for genetic and environmental influences that twins share; and a regression of age acceleration, defined as a discrepancy between chronological age and DNA methylation age, on alcohol consumption. METHODS: Participants came from the Finnish Twin Cohorts (FinnTwin12/FinnTwin16; N = 1,004; 55% female; average age = 23 years). Individuals reported the number of alcoholic beverages consumed in the past week, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. RESULTS: In the EWAS, alcohol consumption was significantly related to methylation at 24 CpG sites. When evaluating whether differences between twin siblings (185 monozygotic pairs) in alcohol consumption predicted differences in DNA methylation, co-twin comparisons replicated 4 CpG sites from the EWAS and identified 23 additional sites. However, when we examined qualitative differences in drinking patterns between twins (heavy drinker vs. light drinker/abstainer or moderate drinker vs. abstainer; 44 pairs), methylation patterns did not significantly differ within twin pairs.

We aimed to assess the performance of the top hits from previous epigenome-wide association studies in prediction of LC incidence. In a prospective nested case-control study, DNA methylation at AHRR (cg05575921), 6p21.33 (cg06126421), and F2RL3 (cg03636183) were measured by pyrosequencing in baseline whole blood samples of 143 incident LC cases identified during 11 years of follow-up and 457 age- and sex-matched controls without diagnosis of LC until the end of follow-up. The individual and joint associations of the 3 markers with LC risk were estimated by logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders including smoking status and cigarette pack-years. The predictive performance was evaluated for both the individual markers and their combinations derived from multiple algorithms. RESULTS: Pronounced demethylation of all 3 markers was observed at baseline among cases compared to controls. Risk of developing LC increased with decreasing DNA methylation levels, with adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 15.86 (4.18-60.17), 8.12 (2.69-4.48), and 10.55 (3.44-32.31), respectively, for participants in the lowest quartile of AHRR, 6p21.33, and F2RL3 compared to participants in the highest 2 quartiles of each site among controls. The individual 3 markers exhibited similar accuracy in predicting LC incidence, with AUCs ranging from 0.79 to 0.81. Combination of the 3 markers did not improve the predictive performance (AUC = 0.80). The individual markers or their combination outperformed self-reported smoking exposure particularly in light smokers. No variation in risk prediction was identified with respect to age, follow-up time, and histological subtypes.

In cord blood samples of 2425 children from five cohorts with aggression assessed at mean ages ranging from 4 to 7 years, 83% of these sites showed the same direction of association with childhood aggression (r = 0.74, p = 0.006) but no epigenome-wide significant sites were found. Top-sites (48 at a false discovery rate of 5% in the peripheral blood meta-analysis or in a combined meta-analysis of peripheral blood and cord blood) have been associated with chemical exposures, smoking, cognition, metabolic traits, and genetic variation (mQTLs). Three genes whose expression levels were associated with top-sites were previously linked to schizophrenia and general risk tolerance. At six CpGs, DNA methylation variation in blood mirrors variation in the brain. On average 44% (range = 3-82%) of the aggression-methylation association was explained by current and former smoking and BMI. These findings point at loci that are sensitive to chemical exposures with potential implications for neuronal functions. We hope these results to be a starting point for studies leading to applications as peripheral biomarkers and to reveal causal relationships with aggression and related traits.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: agression,Meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1038/s41380-020-00987-x,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aggression;Child;Child, Preschool;CpG Islands/genetics;*DNA Methylation/genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics;*Epigenome;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Longevity;Middle Aged;Young Adult;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation",33420481,PMC8263810

However, no large-scale study has investigated whether site-specific DNA methylation predicts all-cause mortality. We used the Illumina-HumanMethylation450-BeadChip to identify blood DNA methylation sites associated with all-cause mortality for 12, 300 participants in 12 Cohorts of the Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. Over an average 10-year follow-up, there were 2,561 deaths across the cohorts. Nine sites mapping to three intergenic and six gene-specific regions were associated with mortality (P < 9.3x10(-7)) independently of age and other mortality predictors. Six sites (cg14866069, cg23666362, cg20045320, cg07839457, cg07677157, cg09615688)-mapping respectively to BMPR1B, MIR1973, IFITM3, NLRC5, and two intergenic regions-were associated with reduced mortality risk. The remaining three sites (cg17086398, cg12619262, cg18424841)-mapping respectively to SERINC2, CHST12, and an intergenic region-were associated with increased mortality risk. DNA methylation at each site predicted 5%-15% of all deaths. We also assessed the causal association of those sites to age-related chronic diseases by using Mendelian randomization, identifying weak causal relationship between cg18424841 and cg09615688 with coronary heart disease. Of the nine sites, three (cg20045320, cg07839457, cg07677157) were associated with lower incidence of heart disease risk and two (cg20045320, cg07839457) with smoking and inflammation in prior CHARGE analyses. Methylation of cg20045320, cg07839457, and cg17086398 was associated with decreased expression of nearby genes (IFITM3, IRF, NLRC5, MT1, MT2, MARCKSL1) linked to immune responses and cardiometabolic diseases. These sites may serve as useful clinical tools for mortality risk assessment and preventative care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.18632/aging.103408,"Adult;Aged;Aging;Cause of Death;Chromosome Mapping;Chronic Disease/epidemiology;Cohort Studies;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Meta-Analysis as Topic;Middle Aged;*Predictive Value of Tests;Quantitative Trait Loci;Risk Assessment;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA",32697766,PMC7425458

METHODS: Using a nested case-control study design, incident pancreatic cancer cases and matched controls were identified from participants who provided blood at baseline in 3 prospective cohort studies. DNA methylation levels were measured in DNA extracted from leukocytes using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Average follow-up period for this analysis was 13 years. RESULTS: Several new genomic regions were identified as being differentially methylated in cases and controls; the 5 strongest associations were observed for CpGs located in genes TMEM204/IFT140, MFSD6L, FAM134B/RETREG1, KCNQ1D, and C6orf227. For some CpGs located in chromosome 16p13.3 (near genes TMEM204 and IFT140), associations were stronger with shorter time to diagnosis (eg, odds ratio [OR] = 5.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52 to 23.12, for top vs bottom quartile, for <5 years between blood draw and cancer diagnosis), but associations remained statistically significantly higher even when cases were diagnosed over 10 years after blood collection. Statistically significant differences in DNA methylation levels were also observed in the gastric secretion pathway using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in DNA methylation in peripheral blood may mark alterations in metabolic or immune pathways that play a role in pancreatic cancer. Identifying new biological pathways in carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer using epigenome-wide association studies approach could provide new opportunities for improving treatment and prevention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/jncics/pkaa041,Pancreatic Neoplasms;Genome;Epigenomics;Genomics,33134824,PMC7583152

METHODS: - We selected individuals with progressive hyperglycaemia exposure based on T2DM diagnostic criteria: 27 with long-term exposure, 34 with short-term exposure and 34 normoglycaemic controls. DNA from blood at inclusion and at the 6-year visit was subjected to methylation analysis using 850K methylation-EPIC arrays. A linear mixed model was used to perform an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identify methylated changes associated with hyperglycaemia exposure during a 6-year time-period. RESULTS: - We did not identify differentially methylated sites that reached false discovery rate (FDR)-significance in our cohort. Based on EWAS, we focused our analysis on methylation sites that had a constant effect during the 6 years across the hyperglycaemia groups compared to controls and found the most statistically significant site was the reported cg19693031 probe (TXNIP). We also performed an EWAS with HbA1c, using the inclusion and the 6-year methylation data and did not identify any FDR-significant CpGs.

In 2014, a follow-up study (ACHS-II) was conducted to measure the same PCBs as in ACHS-I and additional compounds e.g., polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like non-ortho (cPCBs) substituted PCBs. In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), we examined the associations between PCDD, PCDF, and PCB exposures and DNA methylation.

Most of the associations (six, 60%) represented hypomethylation changes. Of the 10 unique CpGs, eight (80%) were in genes shown to be associated with dioxins and/or PCBs based on data from the 2019 Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.

Previous genome-wide methylomic studies on depression have suggested that, along with differential DNA methylation, affected co-twins of monozygotic (MZ) pairs have increased DNA methylation variability, probably in line with theories of epigenetic stochasticity. Nevertheless, the potential biological roots of this variability remain largely unexplored. The current study aimed to evaluate whether DNA methylation differences within MZ twin pairs were related to differences in their psychopathological status. Data from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to evaluate peripheral blood DNA methylation of 34 twins (17 MZ pairs). Two analytical strategies were used to identify (a) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and (b) variably methylated probes (VMPs). Most DMPs were located in genes previously related to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Remarkably, one of these DMPs (cg01122889) was located in the WDR26 gene, the DNA sequence of which has been implicated in major depressive disorder from genome-wide association studies. Expression of WDR26 has also been proposed as a biomarker of depression in human blood. Complementarily, VMPs were located in genes such as CACNA1C, IGF2 and the p38 MAP kinase MAPK11, showing enrichment for biological processes such as glucocorticoid signaling. These results expand on previous research to indicate that both differential methylation and differential variability have a role in the etiology and clinical manifestation of depression, and provide clues on specific genomic loci of potential interest in the epigenetics of depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1038/tp.2015.49,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing;Adult;Calcium Channels, L-Type/genetics;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Depressive Disorder/genetics/psychology;Depressive Disorder, Major/*genetics/psychology;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Humans;Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics;Male;Middle Aged;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 11/genetics;Proteins/genetics;Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics/psychology;Young Adult;Genome;Methylation;Genomics;Twins",25918994,PMC4462612

We investigated the epigenome-wide association of prevalent diabetes with DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood. METHODS: DNAm was measured in whole blood with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in two subsamples of participants from the ESTHER cohort study. Cohort 1 included 988 participants, who were consecutively recruited between July and October 2000 and cohort 2 included 527 randomly selected participants. The association of DNAm with prevalent type 2 diabetes at recruitment was estimated using median regression analysis adjusting for sex, age, BMI, smoking behaviour, cell composition and batch at 361,922 CpG sites. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was prevalent in 16% of the participants, and diabetes was poorly controlled in 45% of the diabetic patients. In cohort 1 (discovery) DNAm at 39 CpGs was significantly associated with prevalent diabetes after correction for multiple testing. In cohort 2 (replication) at one of these CpGs, DNAm was still significantly associated. Decreasing methylation levels at cg19693031 with increasing fasting glucose and HbA1c concentrations were observed using restricted cubic spline analysis. In diabetic patients with poorly controlled diabetes, the decrease in estimated DNAm levels was approximately 5% in comparison with participants free of diagnosed diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Cg19693031, which is located within the 3'-untranslated region of TXNIP, might play a role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. This result appears biologically plausible given that thioredoxin-interacting protein is overexpressed in diabetic animals and humans and 3'-untranslated regions are known to play a regulatory role in gene expression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1007/s00125-015-3773-7,"3' Untranslated Regions;Aged;Blood Glucose/analysis;Body Mass Index;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cohort Studies;CpG Islands;Cross-Sectional Studies;*DNA Methylation;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics/*metabolism;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Leukocytes/*cytology;Male;Middle Aged;Smoking;Surveys and Questionnaires;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Methylation;DNA",26433941,

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We designed a 2-stage, cross-sectional, epigenome-wide association study. Age-independent cardiovascular risk calculation was based on vascular age and on the residuals of the relationship between age and cardiovascular risk. Blood DNA methylomes from 2 independent populations were profiled using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The discovery stage of these studies was performed in the REGICOR cohort (REgistre GIroní del COR; n=645). Next, we validated the initial findings in the Framingham Offspring Study (n=2542). Eight CpGs located in 4 genes (AHRR, CPT1A, PPIF, and SBNO2) and 3 intergenic regions showed differential methylation in association with age-independent cardiovascular risk (P≤1.17×10(-7)). These CpGs explained 12.01% to 15.16% of the variability of age-independent cardiovascular risk in REGICOR and 7.51% to 8.53% in Framingham Offspring Study. Four of them were only related to smoking, 3 were related to smoking and body mass index, and 1 to diabetes mellitus, triglycerides levels, and body mass index (P≤7.81×10(-4)). In addition, we developed methylation risk scores based on these CpGs and observed an association between these scores and cardiovascular disease incidence (hazard ratio=1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.51). CONCLUSIONS: Age-independent cardiovascular risk was related to different DNA methylation profiles, with 8 CpGs showing differential methylation patterns. Most of these CpGs were associated with smoking, and 3 of them were also related to body mass index.

RESULTS: We performed a large meta-analysis of individual epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of prevalent T2D conducted in four European studies using peripheral blood DNAm. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMR) was also undertaken, based on the meta-analysis results. We found three novel CpGs associated with prevalent T2D in Europeans at cg00144180 (HDAC4), cg16765088 (near SYNM) and cg24704287 (near MIR23A) and confirmed three CpGs previously identified (mapping to TXNIP, ABCG1 and CPT1A). We also identified 77 T2D associated DMRs, most of them hypomethylated in T2D cases versus controls.

Although BDR is affected by gene and environmental factors, the influence of DNA methylation is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify epigenetic markers in whole blood associated with BDR, study their functional consequences by multi-omic integration, and assess their clinical applicability in admixed populations with a high asthma burden. METHODS: We studied 414 children and young adults (8-21 years old) with asthma in a discovery and replication design. We performed an epigenome-wide association study on 221 African Americans and replicated the results on 193 Latinos. Functional consequences were assessed by integrating epigenomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and environmental exposure data. Machine learning was used to develop a panel of epigenetic markers to classify treatment response.

However, there is limited research on the underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the pathophysiology and a possible causal pathway from treatment exposures to cardiometabolic conditions, we conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify the DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with cancer treatment exposures and examined whether treatment-associated DNAm sites mediate associations between specific treatments and cardiometabolic conditions. METHODS: We included 2052 survivors (median age 33.7 years) of European ancestry from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation were abstracted from medical records. Seven cardiometabolic conditions were clinically assessed. DNAm profile was measured using MethylationEPIC BeadChip with blood-derived DNA. RESULTS: By performing multiple treatment-specific EWAS, we identified 935 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites mapped to 538 genes/regions associated with one or more cancer treatments at the epigenome-wide significance level (p < 9 × 10(-8)). Among the treatment-associated CpGs, 8 were associated with obesity, 63 with hypercholesterolemia, and 17 with hypertriglyceridemia (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05). We observed substantial mediation by methylation at four independent CpGs (cg06963130, cg21922478, cg22976567, cg07403981) for the association between abdominal field radiotherapy (abdominal-RT) and risk of hypercholesterolemia (70.3%) and by methylation at three CpGs (cg19634849, cg13552692, cg09853238) for the association between abdominal-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (54.6%). In addition, three CpGs (cg26572901, cg12715065, cg21163477) partially mediated the association between brain-RT and obesity with a 32.9% mediation effect, and two CpGs mediated the association between corticosteroids and obesity (cg22351187, 14.2%) and between brain-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (cg13360224, 10.5%). Notably, several mediator CpGs reside in the proximity of well-established dyslipidemia genes: cg21922478 (ITGA1) and cg22976567 (LMNA).

We aimed to identify and replicate previously published genomic loci where DNA methylation changes are attributable to in utero exposures in the NutriGen birth cohort studies Alliance. METHODS: We reviewed the literature to identify differentially methylated sites of newborn DNA which are associated with the following five traits of interest maternal diabetes, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diet during pregnancy, smoking, and gestational age. We then attempted to replicate these published associations in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) and the South Asian birth cohort (START) cord blood epigenome-wide data. RESULTS: We screened 68 full-text articles and identified a total of 17 cord blood epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of the traits of interest. Out of the 290 CpG sites reported, 19 were identified in more than one study; all of them associated with maternal smoking. In CHILD and START EWAS, thousands of sites associated with gestational age were identified and maintained significance after correction for multiple testing. In CHILD, there was differential methylation observed for 8 of the published maternal smoking sites. No other traits tested (i.e., folate levels, gestational diabetes, birthweight) replicated in the CHILD or START cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy and gestational age are strongly associated with differential methylation in offspring cord blood, as assessed in the EWAS literature and our birth cohorts. There are a limited number of reported methylation sites associated in more than two independent studies related to pregnancy.

DNA methylation patterns can also serve as potential biomarkers for disease progression and response to therapy. However, the full dynamics of DNA methylation across daily physiologic events have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: We sought to study how ingesting a standardized meal acutely affects peripheral blood DNA methylation. DESIGN: We performed an observational study in healthy men (n = 26) on DNA methylation and gene expression in whole blood before and 160 min after the ingestion of a standardized meal. Cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation was assayed on the HumanMethylation450k microarray, and gene expression was measured with the Human Gene 2.1 ST Array. RESULTS: Differential methylation after food intake was detected in 13% of the analyzed probes (63,207 CpG probes) at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). This effect was driven by changes in leukocyte fractions as estimated from comparisons against methylation datasets generated from sorted leukocytes. When methylation values were adjusted for estimated leukocyte fractions, 541 probes were observed to be altered in the postprandial state (5% FDR). CONCLUSIONS: Apparent alterations in DNA methylation 160 min after meal ingestion mainly reflect changes in the estimated leukocyte population in whole blood. These results have major methodologic implications for genome-wide methylation studies because they highlight the strong underlying effects of changes in leukocyte fractions on CpG methylation patterns as well as the potential importance of meal-standardized sampling procedures for future investigations when alterations in white blood cell fractions are unavailable.

However, little is known about the variation of methylation markers in the population and their stability over time, both important factors in the design and interpretation of EWAS. We aimed to identify stable variable methylated probes (VMP), i.e., markers that are variable in the population, yet stable over time. METHODS: We estimated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for each probe on the Illumina 450K methylation array in paired samples collected approximately 6 years apart from 92 participants in the Breakthrough Generations Study. We also evaluated relationships with age, reproductive and hormonal history, weight, alcohol intake, and smoking. RESULTS: Approximately 17% of probes had an ICC > 0.50 and were considered stable VMPs (stable-VMPs). Stable-VMPs were enriched for probes located in ""shores"" bordering CpG islands, and at approximately 1.3 kb downstream from the transcription start site in the transition between the unmethylated promoter and methylated gene body. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses provided strong evidence for associations between changes in methylation levels and aging. Smoking-related probes at 2q37.1 and AHRR were stable-VMPs and related to time since quitting. We also observed associations between methylation and weight changes.

The neonatal epigenome has the potential to reflect past interactions between genetic and environmental factors during early development and influence future health outcomes. METHODS: We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 152 umbilical cord blood samples from the MARBLES and EARLI high-familial risk prospective cohorts to identify an epigenomic signature of ASD at birth. Samples were split into discovery and replication sets and stratified by sex, and their DNA methylation profiles were tested for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between ASD and typically developing control cord blood samples. DMRs were mapped to genes and assessed for enrichment in gene function, tissue expression, chromosome location, and overlap with prior ASD studies. DMR coordinates were tested for enrichment in chromatin states and transcription factor binding motifs. Results were compared between discovery and replication sets and between males and females. RESULTS: We identified DMRs stratified by sex that discriminated ASD from control cord blood samples in discovery and replication sets. At a region level, 7 DMRs in males and 31 DMRs in females replicated across two independent groups of subjects, while 537 DMR genes in males and 1762 DMR genes in females replicated by gene association. These DMR genes were significantly enriched for brain and embryonic expression, X chromosome location, and identification in prior epigenetic studies of ASD in post-mortem brain. In males and females, autosomal ASD DMRs were significantly enriched for promoter and bivalent chromatin states across most cell types, while sex differences were observed for X-linked ASD DMRs. Lastly, these DMRs identified in cord blood were significantly enriched for binding sites of methyl-sensitive transcription factors relevant to fetal brain development. CONCLUSIONS: At birth, prior to the diagnosis of ASD, a distinct DNA methylation signature was detected in cord blood over regulatory regions and genes relevant to early fetal neurodevelopment. Differential cord methylation in ASD supports the developmental and sex-biased etiology of ASD and provides novel insights for early diagnosis and therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: cord blood,No environmental factor",10.1186/s13073-020-00785-8,"Autism Spectrum Disorder/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics;Biomarkers;Brain/metabolism;Child, Preschool;Computational Biology/methods;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenome;Erythrocyte Count;Female;*Fetal Blood;Gene Expression Regulation;*Genes, X-Linked;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Machine Learning;Male;*Neurogenesis;Organ Specificity/genetics;Prognosis;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Fetal Blood;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Autistic Disorder",33054850,PMC7559201

METHODS: In this study, we performed an EWAS of PTSD in a cohort of Veterans (n = 378 lifetime PTSD cases and 135 controls) from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) cohort assessed using the Illumina EPIC Methylation BeadChip which assesses DNAm at more than 850,000 sites throughout the genome. Our model included covariates for ancestry, cell heterogeneity, sex, age, and a smoking score based on DNAm at 39 smoking-associated CpGs. We also examined in EPIC-based DNAm data generated from pre-frontal cortex (PFC) tissue from the National PTSD Brain Bank (n = 72). RESULTS: The analysis of blood samples yielded one genome-wide significant association with PTSD at cg19534438 in the gene G0S2 (p = 1.19 × 10(-7), p(adj) = 0.048). This association was replicated in an independent PGC-PTSD-EWAS consortium meta-analysis of military cohorts (p = 0.0024). We also observed association with the smoking-related locus cg05575921 in AHRR despite inclusion of a methylation-based smoking score covariate (p = 9.16 × 10(-6)), which replicates a previously observed PGC-PTSD-EWAS association (Smith et al. 2019), and yields evidence consistent with a smoking-independent effect. The top 100 EWAS loci were then examined in the PFC data. One of the blood-based PTSD loci, cg04130728 in CHST11, which was in the top 10 loci in blood, but which was not genome-wide significant, was significantly associated with PTSD in brain tissue (in blood p = 1.19 × 10(-5), p(adj) = 0.60, in brain, p = 0.00032 with the same direction of effect). Gene set enrichment analysis of the top 500 EWAS loci yielded several significant overlapping GO terms involved in pathogen response, including ""Response to lipopolysaccharide"" (p = 6.97 × 10(-6), p(adj) = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: The cross replication observed in independent cohorts is evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral tissue can yield consistent and replicable PTSD associations, and our results also suggest that that some PTSD associations observed in peripheral tissue may mirror associations in the brain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-020-0820-0,"Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/blood/*genetics;Case-Control Studies;Cell Cycle Proteins/blood/*genetics;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Frontal Lobe/chemistry;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods;Humans;Male;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Repressor Proteins/blood/*genetics;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/blood/*genetics;Sulfotransferases/*genetics;United States;*Veterans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Epigenomics",32171335,PMC7071645

Smoking-related epigenetic biomarkers may open new avenues to better quantify the adverse health effects of smoking, and to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of F2RL3 methylation, a novel epigenetic biomarker of smoking exposure disclosed by recent genome-wide methylation studies. METHODS: Blood DNA methylation at F2RL3 (also known as PAR-4) was quantified in baseline samples of 3588 participants aged 50-75 years in a large population-based prospective cohort study by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 10.1 years. The associations of methylation intensity and of smoking with all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other mortality were assessed by Cox's proportional hazards regression, controlling for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Lower methylation intensity at F2RL3 was strongly associated with mortality. After adjustment for multiple covariates including smoking, hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, cancer or other causes were 2.60 (95% CI, 1.81-3.74), 2.45 (95% CI, 1.28-4.68), 2.94 (95% CI, 1.68-5.14) and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.11-5.16), respectively, in subjects in the lowest quartile of methylation intensity compared with subjects in the highest quartile. The associations with mortality outcomes were much stronger among men than among women. In addition, strong positive associations of smoking with each of the outcomes were substantially weakened, and almost disappeared when controlling for F2RL3 methylation intensity. CONCLUSIONS: F2RL3 methylation is a strong predictor of mortality, including all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other mortality.

However, an important limitation of conventional EWAS is that profiles of epigenetic variability are often obtained in samples of mixed cell types. Here, we aim to assess whether changes in cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) exposure and early childhood growth markers occur in a cell type-specific manner. RESULTS: We analyzed 275 cord blood samples collected at delivery from a prospective pre-birth cohort with genome-wide DNAm profiled by the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We estimated proportions of seven common cell types in each sample using a cord blood-specific DNAm reference panel. Leveraging a recently developed approach named CellDMC, we performed cell type-specific EWAS to identify CpG loci significantly associated with GDM, or 3-year-old body mass index (BMI) z-score. A total of 1410 CpG loci displayed significant cell type-specific differences in methylation level between 23 GDM cases and 252 controls with a false discovery rate < 0.05. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that LDL transportation emerged from CpG specifically identified from B-cells DNAm analyses and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway emerged from CpG specifically identified from natural killer cells DNAm analyses. In addition, we identified four and six loci associated with 3-year-old BMI z-score that were specific to CD8+ T-cells and monocytes, respectively. By performing genome-wide permutation tests, we validated that most of our detected signals had low false positive rates. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional EWAS adjusting for the effects of cell type heterogeneity, the proposed approach based on cell type-specific EWAS could provide additional biologically meaningful associations between CpG methylation, prenatal maternal GDM or 3-year-old BMI. With careful validation, these findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis, programming, and consequences of related childhood metabolic dysregulation.

Little is known, however, about how perceived racial discrimination influences DNA methylation (DNAm) among African Americans (AAs). We examined the association of experiences of discrimination with DNAm among AA women in the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) study. METHODS: The InterGEN study examines the effects of genetic and psychological factors on blood pressure among AA women and their children. Measures include the Major Life Discrimination (MLD) and the Race-Related Events (RES) scales. In the present analysis, we examined discrimination and DNAm at baseline in the InterGEN study. The 850K EPIC Illumina BeadChip was used for evaluating DNAm in this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two women contributed data for the RES-EWAS analysis and 147 for the MLD-EWAS analysis. Most were 30-39 years old, nonsmokers, had some college education, and had incomes <US$15,000/year. After controlling for age, smoking, and cell composition, MLD was significantly associated with DNAm at nine CpG (regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide) sites (false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected p < .05). For the RES-EWAS analysis, no DNAm sites passed the epigenome-wide significance level after genomic control, though suggestive associations were observed at CpG sites after genomic control (raw p < 10(-5)). CONCLUSION: We observed significant epigenetic associations between disease-associated genes (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and asthma) and perceived discrimination as measured by the MLD Scale. Future health disparities research should include epigenetics in high-risk populations to elucidate functional consequences induced by the psychosocial environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Racial discrimination | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1177/1099800417748759,"Adult;Black or African American/*genetics;Asthma/genetics;Blood Pressure/*genetics;Child;DNA/*analysis;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenomics;Female;Humans;Male;*Racism;Risk Factors;United States;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Discrimination (Psychology);DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Methylation;African Americans;DNA",29258399,PMC5741522

We analysed associations between newborn DNA methylation (DNAm), neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging data, and neurodevelopment. METHODS: Neurodevelopment was assessed in 161 children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study at 2 years of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of neurodevelopmental delay using DNAm from cord blood. Subsequently, we analysed if associations between DNAm and neurodevelopmental delay were mediated by altered neonatal brain volumes (subset of 51 children). RESULTS: Differential DNAm at SPTBN4 (cg26971411, Δbeta = -0.024, p-value = 3.28 × 10(-08)), and two intergenic regions (chromosome 11: cg00490349, Δbeta = -0.036, p-value = 3.02 × 10(-08); chromosome 17: cg15660740, Δbeta = -0.078, p-value = 6.49 × 10(-08)) were significantly associated with severe neurodevelopmental delay. While these associations were not mediated by neonatal brain volume, neonatal caudate volumes were independently associated with neurodevelopmental delay, particularly in language (Δcaudate volume = 165.30 mm(3), p = 0.0443) and motor (Δcaudate volume = 365.36 mm(3), p-value = 0.0082) domains. CONCLUSIONS: Differential DNAm from cord blood and increased neonatal caudate volumes were independently associated with severe neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age. These findings suggest that neurobiological signals for severe developmental delay may be detectable in very early life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: cord blood",10.1080/15622975.2021.2016955,"Infant, Newborn;Humans;Cohort Studies;*DNA Methylation;South Africa;*Birth Cohort;Brain/pathology;Brain;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Methylation",34895032,PMC9273810

The placenta, a transient organ at the maternal-fetal interface, regulates fetal growth. Identifying genetic loci where DNA methylation in placenta is associated with birthweight can unravel genomic pathways that are dysregulated in aberrant fetal growth and cardiometabolic diseases in later life. RESULTS: We performed placental epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of birthweight in an ethnic diverse cohort of pregnant women (n = 301). Methylation at 15 cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine sites (CpGs) was associated with birthweight (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Methylation at four (26.7%) CpG sites was associated with placental transcript levels of 15 genes (FDR < 0.05), including genes known to be associated with adult lipid traits, inflammation and oxidative stress. Increased methylation at cg06155341 was associated with higher birthweight and lower FOSL1 expression, and lower FOSL1 expression was correlated with higher birthweight. Given the role of the FOSL1 transcription factor in regulating developmental processes at the maternal-fetal interface, epigenetic mechanisms at this locus may regulate fetal development. We demonstrated trans-tissue portability of methylation at four genes (MLLT1, PDE9A, ASAP2, and SLC20A2) implicated in birthweight by a previous study in cord blood. We also found that methylation changes known to be related to maternal underweight, preeclampsia and adult type 2 diabetes were associated with lower birthweight in placenta. CONCLUSION: We identified novel placental DNA methylation changes associated with birthweight. Placental epigenetic mechanisms may underlie dysregulated fetal development and early origins of adult cardiometabolic diseases.

DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations may be a mechanism underlying these effects, but prior investigations of prenatal exposure to phthalates and neonatal DNAm profiles are limited to placental tissue and umbilical cord blood. OBJECTIVE: Conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of the associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates and DNAm in two accessible infant tissues, venous buffy coat blood and buccal epithelial cells (BECs). METHODS: Participants included 152 maternal-infant pairs from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study. Maternal second trimester urine samples were analyzed for nine phthalate metabolites. Blood (n = 74) or BECs (n = 78) were collected from 3-month-old infants and profiled for DNAm using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip. Robust linear regressions were used to investigate the associations between high (HMWPs) and low molecular weight phthalates (LMWPs) and change in methylation levels at variable Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites in infant tissues, as well as the sensitivity of associations to potential confounders. RESULTS: One candidate CpG in gene RNF39 reported by a previous study examining prenatal exposure to phthalates and cord blood DNAm was replicated. The EWAS identified 12 high-confidence CpGs in blood and another 12 in BECs associated with HMWPs and/or LMWPs. Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) associated with two of the CpGs associated with HMWPs in BECs. DISCUSSION: Prenatal exposure to phthalates was associated with DNAm variation at CpGs annotated to genes associated with endocrine hormone activity (i.e., SLCO4A1, TPO), immune pathways and DNA damage (i.e., RASGEF1B, KAZN, HLA-A, MYO18A, DIP2C, C1or109), and neurodevelopment (i.e., AMPH, NOTCH3, DNAJC5). Future studies that characterize the stability of these associations in larger samples, multiple cohorts, across tissues, and investigate the potential associations between these biomarkers and relevant health and neurodevelopmental outcomes are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107183,"DNA Methylation;*Epigenome;Female;Fetal Blood/chemistry;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Phthalic Acids;Placenta/metabolism;Pregnancy;*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Methylation;DNA",35325772,

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.688464,"DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA",34393852,PMC8357987

DNA methylation (DNAm) may be involved in pathways linking prenatal metal exposure and health. In the Project Viva cohort, we analyzed the extent to which metals (As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cs, Cu, Hg, Mg, Mn, Pb, Se, and Zn) measured in maternal erythrocytes were associated with differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) in cord blood and tested if associations persisted in blood collected in mid-childhood. We measured metal concentrations in first-trimester maternal erythrocytes, and DNAm in cord blood (N = 361) and mid-childhood blood (N = 333, 6-10 years) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. For each metal individually, we tested for DMPs using linear models (considered significant at FDR < 0.05), and for DMRs using comb-p (Sidak p < 0.05). Covariates included biologically relevant variables and estimated cell-type composition. We also performed sex-stratified analyses. RESULTS: Pb was associated with decreased methylation of cg20608990 (CASP8) (FDR = 0.04), and Mn was associated with increased methylation of cg02042823 (A2BP1) in cord blood (FDR = 9.73 × 10(-6)). Both associations remained significant but attenuated in blood DNAm collected at mid-childhood (p < 0.01). Two and nine Mn-associated DMPs were identified in male and female infants, respectively (FDR < 0.05), with two and six persisting in mid-childhood (p < 0.05). All metals except Ba and Pb were associated with ≥ 1 DMR among all infants (Sidak p < 0.05). Overlapping DMRs annotated to genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region were identified for Cr, Cs, Cu, Hg, Mg, and Mn.

One potential explanation suggests exposure to early adversity predicts epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation (DNAm), linked to later health. Stress experienced preconception by mothers may associate with DNAm in the next generation. We hypothesized that fathers' exposure to ACEs also associates with their offspring DNAm, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously explored. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of blood DNAm (n = 45) from 3-month-old infants was regressed onto fathers' retrospective ACEs at multiple Cytosine-phosphate-Guanosine (CpG) sites to discover associations. This accounted for infants' sex, age, ethnicity, cell type proportion, and genetic variability. Higher ACE scores associated with methylation values at eight CpGs. Post-hoc analysis found no contribution of paternal education, income, marital status, and parental postpartum depression, but did with paternal smoking and BMI along with infant sleep latency. These same CpGs also contributed to the association between paternal ACEs and offspring attention problems at 3 years.

There is some evidence to suggest that DNA methylation patterns may be altered in frail individuals. METHODS: Participants were 791 people aged 70 years from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. DNA methylation was measured in whole blood. Biological age was estimated using two measures of DNA methylation-based age acceleration-extrinsic and intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration. We carried out an epigenome-wide association study of physical frailty, as defined by the Fried phenotype. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate relative risk ratios for being physically frail or pre-frail according to epigenetic age acceleration. RESULTS: There was a single significant (P = 1.16 × 10-7) association in the epigenome-wide association study comparing frail versus not frail. The same CpG was not significant when comparing pre-frail versus not frail. Greater extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration was associated with an increased risk of being physically frail, but not of being pre-frail. For a year increase in extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration, age- and sex-adjusted relative risk ratios (95% CI) for being physically frail or pre-frail were 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) and 1.02 (1.00, 1.04), respectively. After further adjustment for smoking and chronic disease, the association with physical frailty remained significant. Intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration was not associated with physical frailty status.

The ensuing multiple-test corrections affect the statistical power to detect associations, likely contributing to prevalent limited reproducibility. Array probes measuring proximal CpG sites often have correlated levels of DNAm that may not only be biologically meaningful but also imply statistical dependence and redundancy. New methods that account for such correlations between adjacent probes may enable improved specificity, discovery and interpretation of statistical associations in DNAm array data. RESULTS: We developed a method named Co-Methylation with genomic CpG Background (CoMeBack) that estimates DNA co-methylation, defined as proximal CpG probes with correlated DNAm across individuals. CoMeBack outputs co-methylated regions (CMRs), spanning sets of array probes constructed based on all genomic CpG sites, including those not measured on the array, and without any phenotypic variable inputs. This approach can reduce the multiple-test correction burden, while enhancing the discovery and specificity of statistical associations. We constructed and validated CMRs in whole blood, using publicly available Illumina Infinium 450 K array data from over 5000 individuals. These CMRs were enriched for enhancer chromatin states, and binding site motifs for several transcription factors involved in blood physiology.

Also, maternal folate intake is associated with decreased risk of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the mechanism is not known. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relation between periconceptional folate intake by source and DNA methylation at birth in a cohort of pediatric ALL cases and controls in an epigenome-wide association study. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation status obtained from archived neonatal blood spots from pediatric ALL cases (n = 189) and controls (n = 205) in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS) from 1995-2008 was compared with periconceptional folate from total, food, and supplemental sources using multivariable linear regression. Further stratification was performed by income, education, ethnicity, and total folate intake. We evaluated variable DNA methylation response to periconceptional folate by ALL case status through an interaction term. RESULTS: Two significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with food and supplemental periconceptional folate intake in all subjects (n = 394). The top differentially methylated region at the promoter region of DUSP22(dual specificity phosphatase 22) demonstrated DNA hypermethylation in ALL cases but not in controls in response to total and food folate intake. We further identified 8 interaction term DMPs with variable DNA methylation response to folate intake by ALL case status. Further stratification of the cohort by education and ethnicity revealed a substantially higher number of DMPs associated with supplemental folic acid intake in Hispanic subjects with lower income and educational level. CONCLUSIONS: We identified modest associations between periconceptional folate intake and DNA methylation differing by source, including variation by ALL case status.

Unlike inherited changes in genetic sequence, variation in site-specific methylation varies by tissue, developmental stage, and disease status, and may be impacted by aging and exposure to environmental factors, such as diet or smoking. These non-genetic factors are typically included in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) because they may be confounding factors to the association between methylation and disease. However, missing values in these variables can lead to reduced sample size and decrease the statistical power of EWAS. We propose a site selection and multiple imputation (MI) method to impute missing covariate values and to perform association tests in EWAS. Then, we compare this method to an alternative projection-based method. Through simulations, we show that the MI-based method is slightly conservative, but provides consistent estimates for effect size.

DNA methylation is a key element of the epigenetic program defining different leukocyte subtypes and may provide an alternative to cytology in assessing leukocyte profiles. Our aim was to create a bioinformatic tool to estimate NLR using DNA methylation, and to assess its diagnostic and prognostic performance in human populations.Methods: We developed a DNA methylation-derived NLR (mdNLR) index based on normal isolated leukocyte methylation libraries and established cell-mixture deconvolution algorithms. The method was applied to cancer case-control studies of the bladder, head and neck, ovary, and breast, as well as publicly available data on cancer-free subjects.Results: Across cancer studies, mdNLR scores were either elevated in cases relative to controls, or associated with increased hazard of death. High mdNLR values (>5) were strong indicators of poor survival. In addition, mdNLR scores were elevated in males, in nonHispanic white versus Hispanic ethnicity, and increased with age. We also observed a significant interaction between cigarette smoking history and mdNLR on cancer survival.Conclusions: These results mean that our current understanding of mature leukocyte methylomes is sufficient to allow researchers and clinicians to apply epigenetically based analyses of NLR in clinical and epidemiologic studies of cancer risk and survival.Impact: As cytologic measurements of NLR are not always possible (i.e., archival blood), mdNLR, which is computed from DNA methylation signatures alone, has the potential to expand the scope of epigenome-wide association studies.

In this study, we performed a prospective cohort study of pregnant women (n = 52) using the MassARRAY EpiTYPER assay and analyzed the methylation levels of variably methylated sites, including CPT1A intron 1 and SREBF1 intron 1 CpGs, which were previously verified to be robustly associated with adiposity traits. Although methylation of SREBF1 was associated with body mass index (BMI) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at mid-gestation, this association was attenuated at late gestation, which was consistent with the metabolic switch from an anabolic to a catabolic state. However, the BMI association with CPT1A intron 1 methylation appeared to strengthen at late gestation; this association was mediated by pre-pregnancy BMI-dependent change in the leukocyte proportion during mid-to-late gestation. Thus, the methylation of adiposity-related differentially methylated regions was sensitive to metabolic and immunological changes during mid-to-late gestation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.3390/ijms20051066,"Adiposity/*genetics;Adult;Body Mass Index;Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism;Cholesterol, LDL/blood;*DNA Methylation;Female;Gestational Weight Gain/*genetics;Humans;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Trimester, Third;Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism;Methylation",30823689,PMC6429071

It is important to identify its early-life risk factors. Maternal poor sleep is common in late pregnancy, and previous studies indicated that poor sleep may influence the offspring's adiposity status. However, very few studies in humans investigated the effect of the different sleep parameters (sleep quantity, quality, and timing) on the offspring's adiposity indicators, and long-term studies are even more scarce. In addition, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study therefore aimed to examine the association between the three maternal sleep dimensions in the late pregnancy and the offspring adiposity indicators and to explore the potential mediating effect of the cord blood DNA methylation in the above association. METHODS: Included participants in the current study were 2211 healthy pregnant women with singleton gestation from the Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) and Shanghai Sleep Birth Cohort (SSBC). Maternal nighttime sleep duration, quality, and midpoint (an indicator of circadian rhythm) were assessed by the same instrument in both cohorts during late pregnancy, and the offspring's body mass index (BMI) and subcutaneous fat (SF) were measured at 2 years old. Additionally, in 231 SSBC samples, the genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. The multivariate linear regression was used to determine the associations between the maternal sleep parameters and the offspring adiposity indicators. The epigenome-wide association study was conducted to identify the maternal sleep-related CpG sites. The mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the potential intermediate role of DNA methylation in the association between maternal sleep and offspring adiposity indicators. RESULTS: The mean maternal nighttime sleep duration and the sleep midpoint for combined cohorts were 9.24 ± 1.13 h and 3.02 ± 0.82, respectively, and 24.5% of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality in late pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates, the maternal later sleep midpoint was associated with the increased SF in offspring (Coef. = 0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.87, p < 0.001) at 2 years old. However, no significant associations of the nighttime sleep duration or sleep quality with the offspring adiposity indicators were found. In the SSBC sample, 45 differential methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with the maternal sleep midpoint, and then, we observed 10 and 3 DMPs that were also associated with the offspring's SF and BMI at 2 years, of which cg04351668 (MARCH9) and cg12232388 significantly mediated the relationship of sleep midpoint and SF and cg12232388 and cg12225226 mediated the sleep midpoint-BMI association, respectively.

As whole blood comprises a mix of cell types, it is unclear whether trait-associated DNAm variation is specific to an individual cellular population. We collected three peripheral tissues (whole blood, buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells) from thirty individuals. Whole blood samples were subsequently processed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify five constituent cell-types (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells). DNAm was profiled in all eight sample-types from each individual using the Illumina EPIC array. We identified significant differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different sample types, and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same individual. We found that for the majority of loci variation in DNAm in individual blood cell types was only weakly predictive of variance in DNAm measured in whole blood, although the proportion of variance explained was greater than that explained by either buccal or nasal epithelial samples. Covariation across sample types was much higher for DNAm sites influenced by genetic factors. Overall, we observe that DNAm variation in whole blood is additively influenced by a combination of the major blood cell types. For a subset of sites, however, variable DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to variation in a single blood cell type providing potential mechanistic insight about EWAS findings. Our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1371/journal.pgen.1009443,"Blood Cells;*DNA Methylation;*Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenomics/methods;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Expression Regulation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;*Molecular Epidemiology;Organ Specificity/genetics;Transcriptome;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase",33739972,PMC8011804

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a widely-used measure of peripheral inflammation, but little is known about the genetic and epigenetic factors that influence blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in individuals with PTSD. METHODS: Participants were 286 U.S. military veterans of post-9/11 conflicts (57% with current PTSD). Analyses focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene and DNA methylation at cg10636246 in AIM2-a locus recently linked to CRP levels through results from a large-scale epigenome-wide association study. RESULTS: PTSD was positively correlated with serum CRP levels with PTSD cases more likely to have CRP levels in the clinically-elevated range compared to those without a PTSD diagnosis. Multivariate analyses that controlled for white blood cell proportions, genetic principal components, age and sex, showed this association to be mediated by methylation at the AIM2 locus. rs3091244, a functional SNP in the CRP promoter region, moderated the association between lifetime trauma exposure and current PTSD severity.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that EWASex outperforms the current state of the art tools by using different EWAS datasets. With EWASex, we offer an efficient way to predict and to verify sex that can be easily implemented in any EWAS using blood samples or even other tissue types.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate previously reported, and explore possible new, associations between levels of inflammatory markers and DNA methylation in blood. We used a well-characterized study population consisting of 127 individuals, all of whom were participants in the population-based Västerbotten Intervention Programme cohort and had provided two blood samples, ten years apart. Levels of CRP and 160 other proteins were measured in plasma, and DNA methylation levels (assessed using the 850K Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip) were measured in white blood cell DNA. Associations between CpG methylation and protein levels were estimated using linear mixed models. In the study we were able to confirm the direction for 85 of 102 previously reported protein-methylation associations. Depicting associations in a network allowed us to identify CpG sites with associations to multiple proteins, and ten CpG sites were each associated with three or more inflammatory markers. Furthermore, two genetic regions included nine additional unreported CpG sites that may represent trans-acting methylation sites. Our study supports a complex interaction between DNA methylation and circulating proteins involved in the inflammatory response. The notion of trans-acting methylation sites affecting, or being affected by, the expression of genes on completely different chromosomes should be taken into account when interpreting results from epigenome-wide association studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1080/15592294.2019.1603962,"Adult;Biomarkers/*blood;Blood Proteins/genetics;C-Reactive Protein/genetics;Cohort Studies;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation/*genetics;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Humans;Inflammation/*blood/genetics/pathology;Male;Middle Aged;Risk Factors;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Genetic Markers;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation",31033411,PMC6557598

This study aimed to assess the associations of urinary Se (SeU) with blood lipids and explore the potential mediating DNA methylation sites. We included 2844 non-smoke participants from the second follow-up (2017-2018) of the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort (WHZH) in this study. SeU and blood lipids [i.e., total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)] for all participants were determined. The associations of SeU with blood lipids were analyzed by generalized linear models. Then, we conducted the blood lipids related epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) among 221 never smokers, and the mediation analysis was conducted to explore the potential mediating cytosine-phosphoguanine (CpG) sites in the above associations. In this study, the SeU concentration of the participants in this study was 1.40 (0.94, 2.08) μg/mmol Cr. The SeU was positively associated with TC and LDL, and not associated with TG and HDL. We found 131, 3, and 1 new CpG sites related to TC, HDL, and LDL, respectively. Mediation analyses found that the methylation of cg06964030 (within MIR1306) and cg15824094 (within PLCH2) significantly mediated the positive association between SeU and TC. In conclusion, high levels of Se exposure were associated with increased TC and LDL among non-smokers, and the methylation of MIR1306 and PLCH2 partly mediated Se-associated TC increase. These findings provide new insights into the effects and mechanisms of Se exposure on lipids metabolism and highlight the importance of controlling Se exposure and intake for preventing high blood lipids.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Selenium,body fat",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161815,"Humans;*Selenium/toxicity;DNA Methylation;East Asian People;Non-Smokers;Lipids;Triglycerides;Cholesterol, HDL;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Selenium",36708841,

However, EWAS of PM(2.5) elements (PEs), reflecting different emission sources, are very limited. OBJECTIVES: We performed EWAS of short- and intermediate-term exposure to PM(2.5) and 13 PEs. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNAm may vary by PM(2.5) mass and its elements. METHODS: We repeatedly collected blood samples in the Normative Aging Study and measured leukocyte DNA methylation (DNAm) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. We collected daily PM(2.5) and 13 PEs at a fixed central site. To estimate the associations between each PE and DNAm at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, we incorporated a distributed-lag (0-27 d) term in the setting of median regression with subject-specific intercept and examined cumulative lag associations. We also accounted for selection bias due to loss to follow-up and mortality prior to enrollment. Significantly differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We further conducted regional and pathway analyses to identify significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and pathways. RESULTS: We included 695 men with 1,266 visits between 1999 and 2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75 years. The significant DMPs, DMRs, and pathways varied by to PM(2.5) total mass and PEs. For example, PM(2.5) total mass was associated with 2,717 DMPs and 10,470 DMRs whereas Pb was associated with 3,173 DMPs and 637 DMRs. The identified pathways by PM(2.5) mass were mostly involved in mood disorders, neuroplasticity, immunity, and inflammation, whereas the pathways associated with motor vehicles (BC, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were related with cardiovascular disease and cancer (e.g., ""PPARs signaling"").

However, the role of DNA methylation in CVD etiology remains unclear. RESULTS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on CVD in a longitudinal sample of Swedish twins (535 individuals). We selected CpGs reaching the Bonferroni-corrected significance level (2 [Formula: see text] 10(-7)) or the top-ranked 20 CpGs with the lowest P values if they did not reach this significance level in EWAS analysis associated with non-stroke CVD, overall stroke, and ischemic stroke, respectively. We further applied a bivariate autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR) to evaluate the cross-lagged effect between DNA methylation of these CpGs and cardiometabolic traits (blood lipids, blood pressure, and body mass index). Furthermore, mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether the cross-lagged effects had causal impacts on CVD. In the EWAS models, none of the CpGs we selected reached the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ALT-SR model showed that DNA methylation levels were more likely to predict the subsequent level of cardiometabolic traits rather than the other way around (numbers of significant cross-lagged paths of methylation → trait/trait → methylation were 84/4, 45/6, 66/1 for the identified three CpG sets, respectively). Finally, we demonstrated significant indirect effects from DNA methylation on CVD mediated by cardiometabolic traits.

One mechanism by which smoking (and other environmental factors) might have long-lasting effects is through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. OBJECTIVES: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) investigating alterations in DNA methylation in infants exposed in utero to maternal tobacco smoke, using the Norway Facial Clefts Study. METHODS: The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to assess DNA methylation in whole blood from 889 infants shortly after delivery. Of 889 mothers, 287 reported smoking-twice as many smokers as in any previous EWAS of maternal smoking. CpG sites related to maternal smoking during the first trimester were identified using robust linear regression. RESULTS: We identified 185 CpGs with altered methylation in infants of smokers at genome-wide significance (q-value < 0.05; mean Δβ = ± 2%). These correspond to 110 gene regions, of which 7 have been previously reported and 10 are newly confirmed using publicly available results. Among these 10, the most noteworthy are FRMD4A, ATP9A, GALNT2, and MEG3, implicated in processes related to nicotine dependence, smoking cessation, and placental and embryonic development. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified 10 genes with newly established links to maternal smoking. Further, we note differences between smoking-related methylation changes in newborns and adults, suggesting possible distinct effects of direct versus indirect tobacco smoke exposure as well as potential differences due to age. Further work would be needed to determine whether these small changes in DNA methylation are biologically or clinically relevant.

Variations in offspring's epigenome can reflect the impact and response to in utero glycemic exposure, and may have different consequences for the child. OBJECTIVE: We examined possible differences in associations of basal glucose status and glucose handling during pregnancy with both clinical covariates and offspring cord tissue DNA methylation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 830 mother-offspring dyads from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes cohort. The fetal epigenome of umbilical cord tissue was profiled using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays. Associations of maternal mid-pregnancy fasting (fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) and 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) after a 75-g oral glucose challenge with both maternal clinical phenotypes and offspring epigenome at delivery were investigated separately. RESULTS: Maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index, and blood pressure measures were associated with both FPG and 2hPG, whereas Chinese ethnicity (P = 1.9 × 10-4), maternal height (P = 1.1 × 10-4), pregnancy weight gain (P = 2.2 × 10-3), prepregnancy alcohol consumption (P = 4.6 × 10-4), and tobacco exposure (P = 1.9 × 10-3) showed significantly opposite associations between the 2 glucose measures. Most importantly, we observed a dichotomy in the effects of these glycemic indices on the offspring epigenome. Offspring born to mothers with elevated 2hPG showed global hypomethylation. CpGs most associated with the 2 measures also reflected differences in gene ontologies and had different associations with offspring birthweight.

After Bonferroni-correction (P(α=0.05) = 1.31 × 10(-7)) for genome-wide significance, we identified 3 loci, cg18181703 (SOCS3), cg04502490 (ZNF771), and cg02988947 (LIMD2), where methylation status was associated with body mass index percentile (BMI%), a clinical index for obesity in children, adolescents, and adults. These sites were also associated with multiple metabolic syndrome (MetS) traits, including central obesity, fat depots, insulin responsiveness, and plasma lipids. The SOCS3 methylation locus was also associated with the clinical definition of MetS. In the validation cohort, SOCS3 methylation status was found to be inversely associated with BMI% (P = 1.75 × 10(-6)), waist to height ratio (P = 4.18 × 10(-7)), triglycerides (P = 4.01 × 10(-4)), and MetS (P = 4.01 × 10(-7)), and positively correlated with HDL-c (P = 4.57 × 10(-8)). Functional analysis in a sub cohort (333 individuals) demonstrated SOCS3 methylation and gene expression in PBMCs were inversely correlated (P = 2.93 × 10(-4)) and expression of SOCS3 was positively correlated with status of MetS (P = 0.012).

However, due to the computational cost of fitting multilevel models across the epigenome, most trajectory modelling efforts to date have focused on a subset of CpG sites identified through epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) at individual time-points. METHODS: We propose using linear regression across the repeated measures, estimating cluster-robust standard errors using a sandwich estimator, as a less computationally intensive strategy than multilevel modelling. We compared these two longitudinal approaches, as well as three approaches based on EWAS (associated at baseline, at any time-point and at all time-points), for identifying epigenetic change over time related to an exposure using simulations and by applying them to blood DNA methylation profiles from the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomics Studies (ARIES). RESULTS: Restricting association testing to EWAS at baseline identified a less complete set of associations than performing EWAS at each time-point or applying the longitudinal modelling approaches to the full dataset. Linear regression models with cluster-robust standard errors identified similar sets of associations with almost identical estimates of effect as the multilevel models, while also being 74 times more efficient. Both longitudinal modelling approaches identified comparable sets of CpG sites in ARIES with an association with prenatal exposure to smoking (>70% agreement).

Unfortunately, patients exhibiting these symptoms have already undergone significant dopaminergic neuronal loss. Earlier diagnosis, aided by molecular biomarkers specific to PD, would improve overall patient care. Epigenetic mechanisms, which are modified by both environment and disease pathophysiology, are emerging as important components of neurodegeneration. Alterations to the PD methylome have been reported in epigenome-wide association studies. However, the extent to which methylation changes correlate with disease progression has not yet been reported; nor the degree to which methylation is affected by PD medication. We performed a longitudinal genome-wide methylation study surveying ~850,000 CpG sites in whole blood from 189 well-characterized PD patients and 191 control individuals obtained at baseline and at a follow-up visit ~2 y later. We identified distinct patterns of methylation in PD cases versus controls. Importantly, we identified genomic sites where methylation changes longitudinally as the disease progresses. Moreover, we identified methylation changes associated with PD pathology through the analysis of PD cases that were not exposed to anti-parkinsonian therapy. In addition, we identified methylation sites modulated by exposure to dopamine replacement drugs. These results indicate that DNA methylation is dynamic in PD and changes over time during disease progression.

In this paper, we examine the evidence for genetic effects on DNA methylation in a Mexican American cohort, a population burdened by a high prevalence of obesity. Using an Illumina-based platform and following stringent quality control procedures, we assessed a total of 395 CpG sites in peripheral blood samples obtained from 183 Mexican American individuals for evidence of heritability, proximal genetic regulation and association with age, sex and obesity measures (i.e. waist circumference and body mass index). We identified 16 CpG sites (~4%) that were significantly heritable after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and 27 CpG sites (~6.9%) that showed evidence of genetic effects. Six CpG sites (~2%) were associated with age, primarily exhibiting positive relationships, including CpG sites in two genes that have been implicated in previous genome-wide methylation studies of age (FZD9 and MYOD1). In addition, we identified significant associations between three CpG sites (~1%) and sex, including DNA methylation in CASP6, a gene that may respond to estradiol treatment, and in HSD17B12, which encodes a sex steroid hormone. Although we did not identify any significant associations between DNA methylation and the obesity measures, several nominally significant results were observed in genes related to adipogenesis, obesity, energy homeostasis and glucose homeostasis (ARHGAP9, CDKN2A, FRZB, HOXA5, JAK3, MEST, NPY, PEG3 and SMARCB1).

In addition, we found a significant influence of age and sex on DNA methylation, and report on trend-level, novel associations between DNA methylation and measures of obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No EWAS",10.1371/journal.pone.0073950,"17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*genetics/metabolism;Age Factors;Body Mass Index;Caspase 6/*genetics/metabolism;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;Female;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Variation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Inheritance Patterns;Male;*Mexican Americans;Middle Aged;Obesity/*ethnology/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology;Sex Factors;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Mexican Americans;Obesity;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",24058506,PMC3772804

However, data on the postnatal stability of such DNAm signatures in childhood, as assessed by Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS), are scarce. Objectives of this study were to investigate DNAm signatures associated with in utero tobacco smoke exposure beyond the 12th week of gestation in whole blood of children at age 5.5 years, to replicate previous findings in young European and American children and to assess their biological role by exploring databases and enrichment analysis. DNA methylation was measured in blood of 366 children of the multicentre European Childhood Obesity Project Study using the Illumina Infinium HM450 Beadchip (HM450K). An EWAS was conducted using linear regression of methylation values at each CpG site against in utero smoke exposure, adjusted for study characteristics, biological and technical effects. Methylation levels at five HM450K probes in MYO1G (cg12803068, cg22132788, cg19089201), CNTNAP2 (cg25949550), and FRMD4A (cg11813497) showed differential methylation that reached epigenome-wide significance according to the false-discovery-rate (FDR) criteria (q-value<0.05). Whereas cg25949550 showed decreased methylation (-2% DNAm ß-value), increased methylation was observed for the other probes (9%: cg12803068; 5%: cg22132788; 4%: cg19089201 and 4%: cg11813497) in exposed relative to non-exposed subjects. This study thus replicates previous findings in children ages 3 to 5, 7 and 17 and confirms the postnatal stability of MYO1G, CNTNAP2 and FRMD4A differential methylation. The role of this differential methylation in mediating childhood phenotypes, previously associated with maternal smoking, requires further investigation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1371/journal.pone.0155554,"Child;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation/*genetics;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Europe;Female;Gene Regulatory Networks;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Obesity/*genetics;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*genetics;Smoking/*genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Methylation",27171005,PMC4865176

This study considered the association between problematic adolescent cannabis use and methylation. METHOD: Using an enrichment-based sequencing approach, a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed of problematic adolescent cannabis use in 703 adolescent samples from the Great Smoky Mountain Study. Using epigenomic deconvolution, MWASs were performed for the main cell types in blood: granulocytes, T cells, B cells, and monocytes. Enrichment testing was conducted to establish overlap between cannabis-associated methylation differences and variants associated with negative mental health effects of adolescent cannabis use. RESULTS: Whole-blood analyses identified 45 significant CpGs, and cell type-specific analyses yielded 32 additional CpGs not identified in the whole-blood MWAS. Significant overlap was observed between the B-cell MWAS and genetic studies of education attainment and intelligence. Furthermore, the results from both T cells and monocytes overlapped with findings from an MWAS of psychosis conducted in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: In one of the first methylome-wide association studies of adolescent cannabis use, several methylation sites located in genes of importance for potentially relevant brain functions were identified. These findings resulted in several testable hypotheses by which cannabis-associated methylation can impact neurological development and inflammation response as well as potential mechanisms linking cannabis-associated methylation to potential downstream mental health effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cannabis",10.1016/j.jaac.2021.02.008,Adolescent;*Cannabis;DNA Methylation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Mental Health;*Psychotic Disorders;Cannabis,33631312,PMC8380262

Although opioid dependence (OD) is more prevalent in men, opioid relapse and fatal opioid overdoses have recently increased at a higher rate among women. Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the etiology of OD, though most studies to date have used candidate gene approaches. We conducted the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of OD in a sample of 220 European-American (EA) women (140 OD cases, 80 opioid-exposed controls). DNA was derived from whole blood samples and EWAS was implemented using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array. To identify differentially methylated CpG sites, we performed an association analysis adjusting for age, estimates of cell proportions, smoking status, and the first three principal components to correct for population stratification. After correction for multiple testing, association analysis identified three genome-wide significant differentially methylated CpG sites mapping to the PARG, RERE, and CFAP77 genes. These genes are involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA binding, cell survival, and cell projection. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified RERE risk variants in association with psychiatric disorders and educational attainment. DNA methylation age in the peripheral blood did not differ between OD subjects and opioid-exposed controls. Our findings implicate epigenetic mechanisms in OD and, if replicated, identify possible novel peripheral biomarkers of OD that could inform the prevention and treatment of the disorder.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Opiods",10.1038/s41598-019-41110-7,"Adult;Biomarkers/blood;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA/blood;DNA Methylation/genetics;Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics;Epigenomics/methods;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Humans;Middle Aged;Opioid-Related Disorders/*genetics;United States;White People/genetics;Biological Markers;Analgesics, Opioid",30874594,PMC6420601

Certain CpG sites have been identified as aging-associated in multiple studies, and the majority of the sites identified in various studies show common features regarding location and direction of the methylation change. However, as a whole, the sets of aging-associated CpGs identified in different studies, even with similar tissues and age ranges, show only limited overlap. In this study, we further explore and characterize CpG sites that show close relationship between their DNA methylation level and chronological age during adulthood and which bear the relationship regardless of blood cell type heterogeneity. RESULTS: In this study, with a multivariable regression model adjusted for cell type heterogeneity, we identified 1202 aging-associated CpG sites (a-CpGs, FDR < 5%), in whole blood in a population with an especially narrow age range (40 - 49 years). Repeatedly reported a-CpGs located in genes ELOVL2, FHL2, PENK and KLF14 were also identified. Regions with aging-associated hypermethylation were enriched regarding several gene ontology (GO) terms (especially in the cluster of developmental processes), whereas hypomethylated sites showed no enrichment. The genes with higher numbers of a-CpG hits were more often hypermethylated with advancing age. The comparison analysis revealed that of the 1202 a-CpGs identified in the present study, 987 were identified as differentially methylated also between nonagenarians and young adults in a previous study (The Vitality 90+ study), and importantly, the directions of changes were identical in the previous and in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report that aging-associated DNA methylation features can be identified in a middle-aged population with an age range of only 9 years. A great majority of these sites have been previously reported as aging-associated in a population aged 19 to 90 years. Aging is associated with different types of changes in DNA methylation, clock-like as well as random. We speculate that the a-CpGs identified here in a population with a narrow age-range represent clock-like changes, as they showed concordant methylation behavior in population spanning whole adulthood as well.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s12864-016-2421-z,"Adult;Age Factors;Aging/*genetics;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;*Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenomics/methods;Female;Genome, Human;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Sex Factors;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Aged;Aging;Methylation",26861258,PMC4746895

One of the most widely reported effects of smoking during pregnancy is reduced birth weight which is in turn associated with chronic disease in adulthood. Epigenome-wide association studies have revealed that smokers show a characteristic ""smoking methylation pattern"", and recent authors have proposed that DNA methylation mediates the impact of maternal smoking on birth weight. The aims of the present study were to replicate previous reports that methylation mediates the effect of maternal smoking on birth weight, and for the first time to investigate whether the observed mediation effects are sex-specific in order to account for known sex-specific differences in methylation levels. METHODS: Methylation levels in the cord blood of 313 newborns were determined using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K Beadchip. A total of 5,527 CpG sites selected on the basis of evidence from the literature were tested. To determine whether the observed association between maternal smoking and birth weight was attributable to methylation, mediation analyses were performed for significant CpG sites. Separate analyses were then performed in males and females. RESULTS: Following quality control, 282 newborns eventually remained in the analysis. A total of 25 mothers had smoked consistently throughout the pregnancy. The birthweigt of newborns whose mothers had smoked throughout pregnancy was reduced by >200g. After correction for multiple testing, 30 CpGs showed differential methylation in the maternal smoking subgroup including top ""smoking methylation pattern"" genes AHRR, MYO1G, GFI1, CYP1A1, and CNTNAP2. The effect of maternal smoking on birth weight was partly mediated by the methylation of cg25325512 (PIM1); cg25949550 (CNTNAP2); and cg08699196 (ITGB7). Sex-specific analyses revealed a mediating effect for cg25949550 (CNTNAP2) in male newborns. CONCLUSION: The present data replicate previous findings that methylation can mediate the effect of maternal smoking on birth weight. The analysis of sex-dependent mediation effects suggests that the sex of the newborn may have an influence. Larger studies are warranted to investigate the role of both the identified differentially methylated loci and the sex of the newborn in mediating the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and birth weight.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1186/s12864-018-4652-7,"Adult;Birth Weight/*genetics;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;Female;Fetal Blood/metabolism;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Integrin beta Chains/genetics;Male;Maternal Exposure;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics;Pregnancy;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics;*Smoking;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke",29695247,PMC5922319

Obesity-related genetic variants have been identified, but these explain little of the variation in BMI. Recent studies reported associations between DNA methylation and obesity, mostly in non-Asian populations. METHODS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on general adiposity (body mass index, BMI) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference, WC) in 409 multi-ethnic Asian individuals and replicated BMI and waist-associated DNA methylation CpGs identified in other populations. The cross-lagged panel model and Mendelian randomization were used to assess the temporal relationship between methylation and BMI. The temporal relationship between the identified CpGs and inflammation and metabolic markers was also examined. RESULTS: EWAS identified 116 DNA methylation CpGs independently associated with BMI and eight independently associated with WC at false discovery rate P(FDR) < 0.05 in 409 Asian samples. We replicated 110 BMI-associated CpGs previously reported in Europeans and identified six novel BMI-associated CpGs and two novel WC-associated CpGs. We observed high consistency in association direction of effect compared to studies in other populations. Causal relationship analyses indicated that BMI was more likely to be the cause of DNA methylation alteration, rather than the consequence. The causal analyses using BMI-associated methylation risk score also suggested that higher levels of the inflammation marker IL-6 were likely the consequence of methylation change. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence of an association between obesity and DNA methylation in multi-ethnic Asians and suggests that obesity can drive methylation change. The results also suggested possible causal influence that obesity-related methylation changes might have on inflammation and lipoprotein levels.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,body fat",10.1186/s13148-021-01162-x,Analysis of Variance;Asian People/ethnology/*genetics;Biomarkers/analysis;*Body Mass Index;DNA Methylation/genetics/physiology;Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Obesity/genetics;Waist Circumference/*genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,34670603,PMC8527674

SUMMARY ANSWER: DNAm at 19 CpGs was associated with conception via ART, with no difference found between IVF and ICSI. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Prior studies on either IVF or ICSI show conflicting outcomes, as both widespread effects on DNAm and highly localized associations have been reported. No study on both IVF and ICSI and genome-wide neonatal DNAm has been performed. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a cross-sectional study comprising 87 infants conceived with IVF or ICSI and 70 conceived following medically unassisted conception. The requirement for inclusion in the study was an understanding of the Swedish language and exclusion was the use of donor gametes. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were from the UppstART study, which was recruited from fertility and reproductive health clinics, and the Born into Life cohort, which is recruited from the larger LifeGene study. We measured DNAm from DNA extracted from cord blood collected at birth using a micro-array (450k array). Group differences in DNAm at individual CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) were determined using robust linear models and post-hoc Tukey's tests. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found no association of ART conception with global methylation levels, imprinted loci and meta-stable epialleles. In contrast, we identify 19 CpGs at which DNAm was associated with being conceived via ART (effect estimates: 0.5-4.9%, PFDR < 0.05), but no difference was found between IVF and ICSI. The associated CpGs map to genes related to brain function/development or genes connected to the plethora of conditions linked to subfertility, but functional annotation did not point to any likely functional consequences. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We measured DNAm in cord blood and not at later ages or in other tissues. Given the number of tests performed, our study power is limited and the findings need to be replicated in an independent study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We find that ART is associated with DNAm differences in cord blood when compared to non-ART samples, but these differences are limited in number and effect size and have unknown functional consequences in adult blood. We did not find indications of differences between IVF and ICSI.

Genome-wide surveys of DNA methylation may uncover epigenetic factors influencing lipid metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify whether differential methylation of cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) correlated with lipid phenotypes, we isolated DNA from CD4+ T cells and quantified the proportion of sample methylation at >450 000 CpGs by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip in 991 participants of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network. We modeled the percentage of methylation at individual CpGs as a function of fasting very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) by using mixed linear regression adjusted for age, sex, study site, cell purity, and family structure. Four CpGs (cg00574958, cg17058475, cg01082498, and cg09737197) in intron 1 of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were strongly associated with very-low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=1.8×10(-21) to 1.6×10(-8)) and TG (P=1.6×10(-26) to 1.5×10(-9)). Array findings were validated by bisulfite sequencing. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrating that methylation of the top CpG (cg00574958) was correlated with CPT1A expression. The association of cg00574958 with TG and CPT1A expression were replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (P=4.1×10(-14) and 3.1×10(-13), respectively). DNA methylation at CPT1A cg00574958 explained 11.6% and 5.5% of the variation in TG in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This genome-wide epigenomic study identified CPT1A methylation as strongly and robustly associated with fasting very-low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and TG.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated intervention-associated DNAm changes in children whose mothers participated in 2 randomized controlled trials of micronutrient supplementation before and during pregnancy, as part of the EMPHASIS (Epigenetic Mechanisms linking Preconceptional nutrition and Health Assessed in India and sub-Saharan Africa) study (ISRCTN14266771). DESIGN: We conducted epigenome-wide association studies with blood samples from Indian (n = 698) and Gambian (n = 293) children using the Illumina EPIC array and a targeted study of selected loci not on the array. The Indian micronutrient intervention was food based, whereas the Gambian intervention was a micronutrient tablet. RESULTS: We identified 6 differentially methylated CpGs in Gambians [2.5-5.0% reduction in intervention group, all false discovery rate (FDR) <5%], the majority mapping to ESM1, which also represented a strong signal in regional analysis. One CpG passed FDR <5% in the Indian cohort, but overall effect sizes were small (<1%) and did not have the characteristics of a robust signature. We also found strong evidence for enrichment of metastable epialleles among subthreshold signals in the Gambian analysis. This supports the notion that multiple methylation loci are influenced by micronutrient supplementation in the early embryo. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal preconceptional and pregnancy micronutrient supplementation may alter DNAm in children measured at 7-9 y. Multiple factors, including differences between the nature of the intervention, participants, and settings, are likely to have contributed to the lack of replication in the Indian cohort.

They are found to be highly involved in eight functional groups, including DNA transcription, RNA splicing, membrane, etc. Equally important is that we identify some methylation sites associated with not only sex, but also other phenotypes (age, smoking and drinking level, and cancer). Verification was done through an independent blood cell DNA methylation data (1298 CpG sites from a cancer panel array). The same genomic site-specific influence pattern and potential confounding effects with cancer were observed. The overlapping rate of identified sex affected genes between saliva and blood cell is 81% for X chromosome, and 8% for autosomes. Therefore, correction for sex is necessary. We propose a simple correction method based on independent component analysis, which is a data driven method and accommodates sample differences. Comparison before and after the correction suggests that the method is able to effectively remove the potentially confounding effects of sex, and leave other phenotypes untouched. As such, our method is able to disentangle the sex influence on a genome wide level, and paves the way to achieve more accurate association analyses in genome wide methylation studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1371/journal.pone.0010028,"Chromosomes;Chromosomes, Human, X;*DNA Methylation;Female;*Genome, Human;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Methods;Principal Component Analysis;*Sex Factors;Genomics;Methylation;Genome",20386599,PMC2850313

Thus, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study to compare DNA methylation profiles at approximately 416,000 individual CpG loci from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 50 adopted youth and 33 nonadopted youth. Adopted youth averaged 22 months at adoption, and both groups averaged 15 years at testing; thus, roughly 80% of their lives were lived in similar circumstances.

We tested the hypothesis that maternal psychosocial stress influences DNA methylation (DNAm), which in turn impacts newborn health outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed DNAm at individual, regional, and genome-wide levels to test for associations with maternal stress and newborn birth weight. Maternal venous blood and newborn cord blood (n = 24 and 22, respectively) were assayed for methylation at ∼450,000 CpG sites. Methylation was analyzed by examining CpG sites individually in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), as regional groups using variably methylated region (VMR) analysis in maternal blood only, and through the epigenome-wide measures using genome-wide mean methylation (GMM), Horvath's epigenetic clock, and mitotic age. These methylation measures were tested for association with three measures of maternal stress (maternal war trauma, chronic stress, and experience of sexual violence) and one health outcome (newborn birth weight). We observed that maternal experiences of war trauma, chronic stress, and sexual assault were each associated with decreased newborn birth weight (p < 1.95 × 10(-7) in all cases). Testing individual CpG sites using EWAS, we observed no associations between DNAm and any measure of maternal stress or newborn birth weight in either maternal or cord blood, after Bonferroni multiple testing correction. However, the top-ranked CpG site in maternal blood that associated with maternal chronic stress and sexual violence before multiple testing correction is located near the SPON1 gene. Testing at a regional level, we found increased methylation of a VMR in maternal blood near SPON1 that was associated with chronic stress and sexual violence after Bonferroni multiple testing correction (p = 1.95 × 10(-7) and 8.3 × 10(-6), respectively). At the epigenomic level, cord blood GMM was associated with significantly higher levels of war trauma (p = 0.025) and was suggestively associated with sexual violence (p = 0.053). The other two epigenome-wide measures were not associated with maternal stress or newborn birth weight in either tissue type. Despite our small sample size, we identified associations even after conservative multiple testing correction. Specifically, we found associations between DNAm and the three measures of maternal stress across both tissues; specifically, a VMR in maternal blood and GMM in cord blood were both associated with different measures of maternal stress. The association of cord blood GMM, but not maternal blood GMM, with maternal stress may suggest different responses to stress in mother and newborn. It is noteworthy that we found associations only when CpG sites were analyzed in aggregate, either as VMRs or as a broad summary measure of GMM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.13110/humanbiology.91.2.04,"DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Infant, Newborn;Methylation;Birth Weight;Genome",33942597,

Two sets of genes, one containing 49 genes with hypomethylated CpG sites in their body region and the other containing 33 genes with hypomethylated CpG sites in their promoter region, were differentially expressed among the smokers. Genes in the two gene sets are involved in bone formation, metal ion transport, cell death, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and cerebral cortex development process, revealing epigenetic-transcriptomic pathways to smoking-related diseases such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and cognitive impairment.

The most prominently used tissue in association studies on humans is venous blood. In contrast to the unchangeable genotype, epigenetic DNA methylation is more variable. Methylation is affected not only by a subject's constitution such as age, gender, ethnicity, genotype, lifestyle and health status, but is also determined by tissue-specific cell types. METHODS: PubMed, published before 2017, was researched, documenting the importance of epigenetic analyses on single cell types instead of whole blood in EWAS. RESULTS: Initial studies documented that stressor-induced, mostly marginal, DNA methylation changes in whole-blood samples (< 5% methylation difference) may rely not on uniform distribution of that methylation shift among each blood cell type, but on strongly altered methylation (> 20%) in single cell types. The effect size in single cell types enables the performance of epigenome-wide studies on replicated smaller cohorts, in contrast to the requirement of larger international consortium-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the identification of a specific cell type that is responsible for association between DNA methylation in whole blood with the phenotype of interest, has to be a prioritized experimental approach in association studies. This is a key prerequisite for constructive interpretation of epigenetic signs in the context of diverse biological function of the tissue blood, for detection of causality link between methylation and phenotype and for establishment of valuable clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/ije/dyy029,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Methylation,29506027,

The main objective of the study was to assess the impact of in utero tobacco exposure on DNA methylation in children born at term with appropriate weight at birth. METHODS: Twenty mother-newborn dyads, after uncomplicated pregnancies, in the absence of perinatal illness were included. All mothers were healthy with no cardiovascular risk factors, except for the associated risks among those mothers who smoked. Umbilical cord blood and maternal peripheral venous blood were collected and an epigenome-wide association study was performed using a 450 K epigenome-wide scan (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450BeadChip) with adjustment to normalize the DNA methylation for data cell variability in whole blood. RESULTS: The maternal plasmatic cotinine levels ranged from 10.70-115.40 ng/ml in the exposed group to 0-0.59 ng/ml in the non-exposed group.

Arsenic is associated with a number of health outcomes, with epigenetic modification suggested as a potential mechanism of toxicity. OBJECTIVE: Among a sample of 400 adult participants, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, as measured by blood and urinary total arsenic concentrations, and epigenome-wide white blood cell DNA methylation. METHODS: We used linear regression models to examine the associations between arsenic exposure and methylation at each CpG site, adjusted for sex, age, and batch. Differentially methylated loci were subsequently examined in relation to corresponding gene expression for functional evidence of gene regulation. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we observed four differentially methylated CpG sites with urinary total arsenic concentration and three differentially methylated CpG sites with blood arsenic concentration, based on the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p < 1 × 10(-7). Methylation of PLA2G2C (probe cg04605617) was the most significantly associated locus in relation to both urinary (p = 3.40 × 10(-11)) and blood arsenic concentrations (p = 1.48 × 10(-11)).

Prenatal exposures are believed to influence children's obesity, but it is unknown whether exposures of pregnant mothers can confer a different risk of obesity between sexes, and whether they can affect neurodevelopment. METHODS: We analyzed data from 1044 children from the HELIX project, comprising 93 exposures during pregnancy, and clinical, neuropsychological, and methylation data during childhood (5-11 years). Using exposome-wide interaction analyses, we identified prenatal exposures with the highest sexual dimorphism in obesity risk, which were used to create a multiexposure profile. We applied causal random forest to classify individuals into two environments: E1 and E0. E1 consists of a combination of exposure levels where girls have significantly less risk of obesity than boys, as compared to E0, which consists of the remaining combination of exposure levels. We investigated whether the association between sex and neurodevelopmental delay also differed between E0 and E1. We used methylation data to perform an epigenome-wide association study between the environments to see the effect of belonging to E1 or E0 at the molecular level. RESULTS: We observed that E1 was defined by the combination of low dairy consumption, non-smokers' cotinine levels in blood, low facility richness, and the presence of green spaces during pregnancy (OR(interaction) = 0.070, P = 2.59 × 10(-5)). E1 was also associated with a lower risk of neurodevelopmental delay in girls, based on neuropsychological tests of non-verbal intelligence (OR(interaction) = 0.42, P = 0.047) and working memory (OR(interaction) = 0.31, P = 0.02). In line with this, several neurodevelopmental functions were enriched in significant differentially methylated probes between E1 and E0. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of obesity can be different for boys and girls in certain prenatal environments. We identified an environment combining four exposure levels that protect girls from obesity and neurodevelopment delay. The combination of single exposures into multiexposure profiles using causal inference can help determine populations at risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1186/s12916-023-02815-9,Pregnancy;Child;Humans;Male;Female;*Pediatric Obesity;Sex Characteristics;*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology;Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/analysis;Child Development;Environmental Exposure,37046291,PMC10099694

Due to the substantial overlap that often exists between methylation patterns across different tissues, including blood and brain, blood-based methylation may track methylation changes in brain; however, little work has explored the overlap in alcohol-related methylation in these tissues. METHODS: To study the effects of alcohol on the brain methylome and identify possible biomarkers of these changes in blood, we performed a methylome-wide association study in brain and blood from 40 male DBA/2J mice that received either an acute ethanol (EtOH) or saline intraperitoneal injection. To investigate all 22 million CpGs in the mouse genome, we enriched for the methylated genomic fraction using methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) protein capture followed by next-generation sequencing (MBD-seq). We performed association tests in blood and brain separately followed by enrichment testing to determine whether there was overlapping alcohol-related methylation in the 2 tissues. RESULTS: The top result for brain was a CpG located in an intron of Ttc39b (p = 5.65 × 10(-08) ), and for blood, the top result was located in Espnl (p = 5.11 × 10(-08) ). Analyses implicated pathways involved in inflammation and neuronal differentiation, such as CXCR4, IL-7, and Wnt signaling. Enrichment tests indicated significant overlap among the top results in brain and blood. Pathway analyses of the overlapping genes converge on MAPKinase signaling (p = 5.6 × 10(-05) ) which plays a central role in acute and chronic responses to alcohol and glutamate receptor pathways, which can regulate neuroplastic changes underlying addictive behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we have shown some methylation changes in brain and blood after acute EtOH administration and that the changes in blood partly mirror the changes in brain suggesting the potential for DNA methylation in blood to be biomarkers of alcohol use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No human sample",10.1111/acer.13905,"Animals;Biomarkers/blood;Brain/*metabolism;Cell Differentiation/genetics;Central Nervous System Depressants/*blood/*pharmacology;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Ethanol/*blood/*pharmacology;Inflammation/genetics;Introns/genetics;Lipoproteins, HDL/genetics;MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics;Male;*Metabolome;Mice;Mice, Inbred DBA;Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics;Brain;Alcoholics;Methylation;Ethanol",30320886,PMC6286207

Although children born to women with preeclampsia have a higher risk of hypertension in later life, the mechanism of this increased risk is unknown. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that has been studied as a mediator of cellular memory of adverse exposures in utero. Since each cell type in the body has a unique DNA profile, cell subtype composition is a major confounding factor in studies of tissues with heterogeneous cell types. The best way to avoid this confounding effect is by using purified cell types. However, using purified cell types in large cohort translational studies is difficult. The amnion, the inner layer of the fetal membranes of the placenta, is derived from the epiblast and consists of two cell types, which are easy to isolate from the delivered placenta. In this study, we demonstrate the value of using amnion samples for DNA methylation studies, revealing distinctive patterns between fetuses exposed to proteinuria or hypertension and fetuses from normal pregnancies. RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR (HELP)-tagging, on 62 amnion samples from the placentas of uncomplicated, normal pregnancies and from those with complications of preeclampsia or hypertension. Using a regression model approach, we found 123, 85, and 99 loci with high-confidence hypertension-associated, proteinuria-associated, and hypertension- and proteinuria-associated DNA methylation changes, respectively. A gene ontology analysis showed DNA methylation changes to be selecting genes with different biological processes in exposure status. We also found that these differentially methylated regions overlap loci previously reported as differentially methylated regions in preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support prior observations that preeclampsia is associated with changes of DNA methylation near genes that have previously been found to be dysregulated in preeclampsia. We propose that amniotic membranes represent a valuable surrogate fetal tissue on which to perform epigenome-wide association studies of adverse intrauterine conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1186/s13148-016-0234-1,"Amnion/*metabolism;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Hypertension/*genetics;Pre-Eclampsia/*genetics;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*genetics;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Regression Analysis;Chorioamnionitis;Pre-Eclampsia",27293492,PMC4902972

However, very good disease control is achieved in only 30% of patients, making identification of biomarkers of response a research priority. We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that differential DNA methylation patterns may provide biomarkers predictive of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapy in patients with RA. METHODS: An epigenome-wide association study was performed on pretreatment whole blood DNA from patients with RA. Patients who displayed good response (n = 36) or no response (n = 36) to etanercept therapy at 3 months were selected. Differentially methylated positions were identified using linear regression. Variance of methylation at differentially methylated positions was assessed for correlation with cis-acting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A replication experiment for prioritized SNPs was performed in an independent cohort of 1,204 RA patients. RESULTS: Five positions that were differentially methylated between responder groups were identified, with a false discovery rate of <5%. The top 2 differentially methylated positions mapped to exon 7 of the LRPAP1 gene on chromosome 4 (cg04857395, P = 1.39 × 10(-8) and cg26401028, P = 1.69 × 10(-8) ). The A allele of the SNP rs3468 was correlated with higher levels of methylation for both of the top 2 differentially methylated positions (P = 2.63 × 10(-7) and P = 1.05 × 10(-6) , respectively). Furthermore, the A allele of rs3468 was correlated with European League Against Rheumatism nonresponse in the discovery cohort (P = 0.03; n = 56) and in the independent replication cohort (P = 0.003; n = 1,204). CONCLUSION: We identify DNA methylation as a potential biomarker of response to TNFi therapy, and we report the association between response and the LRPAP1 gene, which encodes a chaperone of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1.

This may be partially attributable to epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to examine whether differential DNA methylation, a major source of epigenetic regulation, can be observed in offspring of mothers with type 2 diabetes during the pregnancy (OMD) compared with offspring of mothers with no diabetes during the pregnancy (OMND). METHODS: DNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. A total of 423,311 CpG sites were analysed in 388 Pima Indian individuals, mean age at examination was 13.0 years, 187 of whom were OMD and 201 were OMND. Differences in methylation between OMD and OMND were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-eight differentially methylated CpG sites (with an empirical false discovery rate ≤0.05), mapping to 29 genes and ten intergenic regions, were identified. The gene with the strongest evidence was LHX3, in which six CpG sites were hypermethylated in OMD compared with OMND (p ≤ 1.1 × 10(-5)). Similarly, a CpG near PRDM16 was hypermethylated in OMD (1.1% higher, p = 5.6 × 10(-7)), where hypermethylation also predicted future diabetes risk (HR 2.12 per SD methylation increase, p = 9.7 × 10(-5)). Hypermethylation near AK3 and hypomethylation at PCDHGA4 and STC1 were associated with exposure to diabetes in utero (AK3: 2.5% higher, p = 7.8 × 10(-6); PCDHGA4: 2.8% lower, p = 3.0 × 10(-5); STC1: 2.9% lower, p = 1.6 × 10(-5)) and decreased insulin secretory function among offspring with normal glucose tolerance (AK3: 0.088 SD lower per SD of methylation increase, p = 0.02; PCDHGA4: 0.08 lower SD per SD of methylation decrease, p = 0.03; STC1: 0.072 SD lower per SD of methylation decrease, p = 0.05). Seventeen CpG sites were also associated with BMI (p ≤ 0.05). Pathway analysis of the genes with at least one differentially methylated CpG (p < 0.005) showed enrichment for three relevant biological pathways. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Intrauterine exposure to diabetes can affect methylation at multiple genomic sites. Methylation status at some of these sites can impair insulin secretion, increase body weight and increase risk of type 2 diabetes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1007/s00125-016-4203-1,"Adolescent;Adult;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation/genetics/*physiology;DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/*metabolism;Diabetes, Gestational/genetics/*metabolism;Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Glycoproteins/genetics;Humans;Infant, Newborn;LIM-Homeodomain Proteins/genetics;Male;Pregnancy;Transcription Factors/genetics;Young Adult;Methylation",28127622,PMC7194355

However, longitudinal data and data in type 1 diabetes are currently very limited. Thus, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in an observational type 1 diabetes cohort to identify loci with DNAme associated with concurrent and future HbA1cs, as well as other clinical risk factors, over 28 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole blood DNAme in 683 597 CpGs was analyzed in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study of childhood onset (<17 years) type 1 diabetes (n=411). An EWAS of DNAme beta values and concurrent HbA1c was performed using linear models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, pack years of smoking, estimated cell type composition variables, and technical/batch covariates. A longitudinal EWAS of subsequent repeated HbA1c measures was performed using mixed models. We further identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) for significant CpGs and conducted a Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: DNAme at cg19693031 (Chr 1, Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP)) and cg21534330 (Chr 17, Casein Kinase 1 Isoform Delta) was significantly inversely associated with concurrent HbA1c. In longitudinal analyses, hypomethylation of cg19693031 was associated with consistently higher HbA1c over 28 years, and with higher triglycerides, pulse rate, and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) independently of HbA1c. We further identified 34 meQTLs in SLC2A1/SLC2A1-AS1 significantly associated with cg19693031 DNAme. CONCLUSIONS: Our results extend prior findings that TXNIP hypomethylation relates to worse glycemic control in type 1 diabetes by demonstrating the association persists over the long term. Additionally, the associations with triglycerides, pulse rate, and ACR suggest TXNIP DNAme could play a role in vascular damage independent of HbA1c. These findings strengthen potential for interventions targeting TXNIP to improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes through its role in SLC2A1/glucose transporter 1-mediated glucose regulation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1136/bmjdrc-2022-003068,"Humans;DNA Methylation;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/epidemiology/genetics;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiology/genetics;Glycated Hemoglobin;Epigenesis, Genetic;Glycemic Control;*Diabetes Complications/epidemiology;Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism;Diabetes Complications;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA",36604111,PMC9827189

We performed a blood-based epigenome-wide association study using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-short form in 602 patients with a current severe mental illness, investigating DNA methylation association separately for five trauma subtypes and the total trauma score. The median trauma score was set as the predefined cutoff for determining whether the trauma was present or not. Additionally, we compared our genome-wide results with methylation probes annotated to candidate genes previously associated with CT. Of the patients, 83.2% reported CT above the cutoff in one or more trauma subtypes, and emotional neglect was the trauma subtype most frequently reported. We identified one significant differently methylated position associated with the gene TANGO6 for physical neglect. Seventeen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were associated with different trauma categories. Several of these DMRs were annotated to genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairments. Our results support a biomolecular association between CT and severe mental disorders.

A problem of considerable practical interest is identification of large scale, global changes in methylation that are associated with environmental variables, clinical outcomes, or other experimental conditions. However, there has been little statistical research on methods for global methylation analysis using technologies with individual CpG resolution. To address this critical gap in the literature, we develop a new strategy for global analysis of methylation profiles using a functional regression approach wherein we approximate either the density or the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the methylation values for each individual using B-spline basis functions. The spline coefficients for each individual are allowed to summarize the individual's overall methylation profile. We then test for association between the overall distribution and a continuous or dichotomous outcome variable using a variance component score test that naturally accommodates the correlation between spline coefficients. Simulations indicate that our proposed approach has desirable power while protecting type I error. The method was applied to detect methylation differences, both genome wide and at LINE1 elements, between the blood samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls and to detect the epigenetic changes of human hepatocarcinogenesis in the context of alcohol abuse and hepatitis C virus infection.

One possible toxicity mechanism is epigenetic modification. Previous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified associations between arsenic exposure and CpG-specific DNA methylation. To provide additional evidence that observed associations represent causal relationships, we examine the association between genetic determinants of arsenic metabolism efficiency (percent dimethylarsinic acid, DMA%, in urine) and DNA methylation among individuals from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (n = 379) and Bangladesh Vitamin E and Selenium Trial (n = 393). METHODS: We used multivariate linear models to assess the association of methylation at 221 arsenic-associated CpGs with DMA% and measures of genetically predicted DMA% derived from three SNPs (rs9527, rs11191527, and rs61735836). We also conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the association between arsenic metabolism efficiency and CpG methylation. RESULTS: Among the associations between DMA% and methylation at each of 221 CpGs, 64% were directionally consistent with associations observed between arsenic exposure and the 221 CpGs from a prior EWAS. Similarly, among the associations between genetically predicted DMA% and each CpG, 62% were directionally consistent with the prior EWAS results. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses produced similar conclusions. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that arsenic exposure effects DNA methylation at specific CpGs in whole blood.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 × 10(-8)). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors.

There is growing evidence that suboptimal intrauterine environment can perturb the metabolic programing of the growing fetus, thereby increasing the risk of developing obesity in later life. However, the link between early exposures in the womb, genetic susceptibility, and perturbed epigenome on metabolic health is not well understood. In this study, we shed more light on this aspect by performing a comprehensive analysis on the effects of variation in prenatal environment, neonatal methylome, and genotype on birth weight and adiposity in early childhood. METHODS: In a prospective mother-offspring cohort (N = 987), we interrogated the effects of 30 variables that influence the prenatal environment, umbilical cord DNA methylation, and genotype on offspring weight and adiposity, over the period from birth to 48 months. This is an interim analysis on an ongoing cohort study. RESULTS: Eleven of 30 prenatal environments, including maternal adiposity, smoking, blood glucose and plasma unsaturated fatty acid levels, were associated with birth weight. Polygenic risk scores derived from genetic association studies on adult adiposity were also associated with birth weight and child adiposity, indicating an overlap between the genetic pathways influencing metabolic health in early and later life. Neonatal methylation markers from seven gene loci (ANK3, CDKN2B, CACNA1G, IGDCC4, P4HA3, ZNF423 and MIRLET7BHG) were significantly associated with birth weight, with a subset of these in genes previously implicated in metabolic pathways in humans and in animal models. Methylation levels at three of seven birth weight-linked loci showed significant association with prenatal environment, but none were affected by polygenic risk score. Six of these birth weight-linked loci continued to show a longitudinal association with offspring size and/or adiposity in early childhood. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that developmental pathways to adiposity begin before birth and are influenced by environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors. These pathways can have a lasting effect on offspring size, adiposity and future metabolic outcomes, and offer new opportunities for risk stratification and prevention of obesity.

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are not endogenously produced in humans and are exclusively derived from the diet. They are pivotal for the fetus growth and neuronal development and seem beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and preventing later allergic disorders in the offspring by modulating the inflammatory immune response. In the present study, we investigated the association between maternal intakes of n-3PUFAs, profiled on maternal erythrocyte membranes at pregnancy term, and offspring DNA methylation on cord blood mononuclear cells in a sample of 118 mother-newborn pairs randomly drawn from the ""Feeding fetus' low-grade inflammation and insulin-resistance"" study cohort. N-3 PUFA content on erythrocyte membranes is a validated biomarker to measure objectively medium term intake of n-3 PUFAs. Based on distribution of n-3 PUFA in the whole cohort of mothers, we identified mothers with low (n-3 PUFA concentration <25th percentile), medium (n-3 PUFAs between 25th and 75th percentiles), and high n-3 PUFA content (>75th percentile). The HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) was used for the epigenome-wide association study using the Infinium Methylation Assay. The overall DNA methylation level was not different between the three groups while there was significant difference in methylation levels at certain sites. Indeed, 8,503 sites had significantly different methylations between low and high n-3 PUFA groups, 12,716 between low and medium n-3 PUFA groups, and 18,148 between high and medium n-3 PUFA groups. We found differentially methylated genes that belong prevalently to pathways of signal transduction, metabolism, downstream signaling of G protein-coupled receptors, and gene expression. Within these pathways, we identified four differentially methylated genes, namely, MSTN, IFNA13, ATP8B3, and GABBR2, that are involved in the onset of insulin resistance and adiposity, innate immune response, phospholipid translocation across cell membranes, and mechanisms of addiction to high fat diet, alcohol, and sweet taste. In conclusion, findings of this preliminary investigation suggest that maternal intake of n-3 PUFAs during pregnancy has potential to influence the offspring DNA methylation. Validation of results in a larger cohort and investigation of biological significance and impact on the phenotype are warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.3389/fgene.2019.01050,Pregnancy;Fetal Blood,31708974,PMC6824245

Studies in the Asian population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of cord blood genome-wide DNA methylation (GWDm) changes with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and children's BMI-z score at preschool age. Additionally, we also explored the genome-wide differentially methylated regions and differentially methylated probes between preschoolers with overweight/obesity and normal-weight counterparts. METHODS: This two-stage study design included (1) a GWDm analysis of 30 mother-child pairs from 633 participants of the Zhuhai birth cohort with data on newborn cord blood, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and children's BMI at 3 years of age; and (2) a targeted validation analysis of the cord blood of ten children with overweight/obesity and ten matched controls to validate the CpG sites. RESULTS: In the first stage, no significant CpG sites were found to be associated with children's BMI-z score at preschool age after FDR correction with the p-values of the CpG sites in FOXN3 (cg23501836) and ZNF264 (cg27437574) being close to 1 × 10(-6) . In the second stage, a significant difference of CpG sites in AHRR (chr5:355067-355068) and FOXN3 (chr14: 89630264-89630272 and chr14: 89630387-89630388) was found between the ten children with overweight/obesity and ten controls (p < 0.05). The CpG sites in FOXN3 (chr14:89630264-89630272 and chr14:89630295-89630296) and ZNF264 (chr19: 57703104-57703107 and chr19: 57703301-57703307) were associated with children's BMI-z score; and the CpG sites in FOXN3 (chr14: 89630264-89630272 and chr14: 89630387-89630388) were associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation in FOXN3 and AHRR is associated with overweight/obesity in preschool-aged children, and the methylation in FOXN3 and ZNF264 might be associated with children's BMI-z score. FOXN3 methylation may be associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, suggesting its potential role in the children's BMI-z score or overweight/obesity.

The overall 5 year survival is approximately 60% and declines with increasing stage at diagnosis, indicating a need for non-invasive tests that facilitate the detection of early disease. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic modification that is amenable to measurement and readily available in peripheral blood. We used a semi-supervised recursively partitioned mixture model (SS-RPMM) approach to identify novel blood DNA methylation markers of HNSCC using genome-wide methylation array data for peripheral blood samples from 92 HNSCC cases and 92 cancer-free control subjects. To assess the performance of the resultant markers, we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the corresponding area under the curve (AUC). Cases and controls were best differentiated by a methylation profile of six CpG loci (associated with FGD4, SERPINF1, WDR39, IL27, HYAL2 and PLEKHA6), with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62-0.82). After adjustment for subject age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption and HPV16 serostatus, the AUC increased to 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76-0.92). We have identified a novel blood-based methylation profile that is indicative of HNSCC with a high degree of accuracy.

Such studies have been more aimed at age prediction or building up the epigenetic clock of age rather than focusing on the dynamic patterns in epigenetic changes during the aging process. METHODS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study of intra-individual longitudinal changes in DNA methylation at CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites measured in whole-blood samples of a cohort of 43 elderly twin pairs followed for 10 years (age at intake 73-82 years). Biological pathway analysis and survival analysis were also conducted on CpGs showing longitudinal change in their DNA-methylation levels. Classical twin models were fitted to each CpG site to estimate the genetic and environmental effects on DNA-methylation. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 2284 CpG sites whose DNA-methylation levels changed longitudinally over the follow-up. Twin modelling revealed that the longitudinal change for 90% of these CpG sites was explained solely by individual unique environmental factors and only for 10% of these sites was it influenced by familial factors (genetic or shared environment). Over 60% of the identified CpG sites were replicated (same direction and replication P < 0.05) in an independent cross-sectional sample of 300 twins aged from 30 to 74 years. The replication rate went up to 91% for the top 53 CpGs with P < 1 × 10-07. Pathway analysis of genes linked to these CpGs identified biologically meaningful gene-sets involved in cellular-signalling events and in transmission across chemical synapses, which are important molecular underpinnings of aging-related degenerative disorders. CONCLUSION: Our epigenome-wide association studies on a cohort of old twins followed up for 10 years identified highly replicable epigenetic biomarkers predominantly implicated in signalling pathways of degenerative disorders and survival in the elderly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/ije/dyw132,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Aging/*genetics;*CpG Islands;Cross-Sectional Studies;*DNA Methylation;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Netherlands;Regression Analysis;Survival Analysis;Twins;Genome;Genomics;Epigenomics",27498152,

The etiology of ASD involves both inherited and environmental risk factors, with epigenetic processes hypothesized as one mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic variation influence gene regulation and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify DNA methylation biomarkers of ASD detectable at birth. METHODS: We quantified neonatal methylomic variation in 1263 infants-of whom ~ 50% went on to subsequently develop ASD-using DNA isolated from archived blood spots taken shortly after birth. We used matched genotype data from the same individuals to examine the molecular consequences of ASD-associated genetic risk variants, identifying methylomic variation associated with elevated polygenic burden for ASD. In addition, we performed DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) mapping to prioritize target genes from ASD GWAS findings. RESULTS: We identified robust epigenetic signatures of gestational age and prenatal tobacco exposure, confirming the utility of DNA methylation data generated from neonatal blood spots. Although we did not identify specific loci showing robust differences in neonatal DNA methylation associated with later ASD, there was a significant association between increased polygenic burden for autism and methylomic variation at specific loci. Each unit of elevated ASD polygenic risk score was associated with a mean increase in DNA methylation of - 0.14% at two CpG sites located proximal to a robust GWAS signal for ASD on chromosome 8. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest analysis of DNA methylation in ASD undertaken and the first to integrate genetic and epigenetic variation at birth. We demonstrate the utility of using a polygenic risk score to identify molecular variation associated with disease, and of using mQTL to refine the functional and regulatory variation associated with ASD risk variants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13073-018-0527-4,"Autism Spectrum Disorder/blood/*genetics;Cohort Studies;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Dried Blood Spot Testing;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Gestational Age;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Male;Multifactorial Inheritance/*genetics;*Parturition;Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics;Reproducibility of Results;Tobacco/adverse effects;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Autistic Disorder",29587883,PMC5872584

In exposed individuals, and in their descendants, adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure, including cancers, genital malformations, and less consistently, psychiatric disorders. We aimed to explore whether prenatal DES exposure would be associated with DNA methylation changes, and whether these epigenetic modifications would be associated with increased risk of psychosis. METHODS: From 247 individuals born from mothers exposed to DES, we selected 69 siblings from 30 families. In each family, at least one sibling was exposed in utero to DES. We performed a methylome-wide association study using HumanMethylation450 DNA Analysis BeadChip® in peripheral blood. We analyzed methylation changes at individual CpGs or regions in exposed (n = 37) versus unexposed individuals (n = 32). We also compared exposed individuals with (n = 7) and without psychosis (n = 30). RESULTS: There were more individuals with schizophrenia in the DES-exposed group. We found no significant differences between exposed and unexposed individuals with respect to differentially methylated CpGs or regions. The largest difference was in a region near the promoter of an ADAMTS proteoglycanase gene (ADAMTS9). Compared to exposed individuals without psychosis, exposed individuals with psychosis had differential methylation in the region encompassing the gene encoding the zinc finger protein 57 (ZFP57).

A prominent example is hypomethylation of the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor repressor (AHRR) locus, which is observed in blood and squamous epithelial cells of smokers, but not in lung cancer. RESULTS: Using a novel systems-epigenomics algorithm, called SEPIRA, which leverages the power of a large RNA-sequencing expression compendium to infer regulatory activity from messenger RNA expression or DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, we infer the landscape of binding activity of lung-specific transcription factors (TFs) in lung carcinogenesis. We show that lung-specific TFs become preferentially inactivated in lung cancer and precursor lung cancer lesions and further demonstrate that these results can be derived using only DNAm data. We identify subsets of TFs which become inactivated in precursor cells. Among these regulatory factors, we identify AHR, the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor which controls a healthy immune response in the lung epithelium and whose repressor, AHRR, has recently been implicated in smoking-mediated lung cancer. In addition, we identify FOXJ1, a TF which promotes growth of airway cilia and effective clearance of the lung airway epithelium from carcinogens. CONCLUSIONS: We identify TFs, such as AHR, which become inactivated in the earliest stages of lung cancer and which, unlike AHRR hypomethylation, are also inactivated in lung cancer itself. The novel systems-epigenomics algorithm SEPIRA will be useful to the wider epigenome-wide association study community as a means of inferring regulatory activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No EWAS,No environmental factor",10.1186/s13059-017-1366-0,"Algorithms;Carcinoma in Situ/genetics/metabolism/pathology;Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology;Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism;Computational Biology/methods;DNA Methylation;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenomics/*methods;Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic;Gene Regulatory Networks;*Gene Silencing;Humans;Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology;Neoplasm Staging;Organ Specificity/genetics;Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*genetics;*Software;Transcription Factors/metabolism;Lung Neoplasms;Transcription Factors;Lung;Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon;Hydrocarbons;Epigenomics",29262847,PMC5738803

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) is important in growth, differentiation, and repair processes after injury. However, no studies investigated the organ-specific persistence of PSE-induced methylation change of Igf1 into adulthood. Based on our previous studies on the PSE effect on Igf1 promoter methylation in fetal and neonatal mouse offspring, we now have extended our studies to adulthood. Our data show that basal Igf1 promoter methylation generally increased in the lung but decreased in the liver (except for 2 persistent CpG sites in both organs) across three different developmental stages. PSE changed Igf1 promoter methylation in all three developmental stages, which was organ and sex specific. The PSE effect was less pronounced in adult offspring compared with the fetal and neonatal stages. In addition, the PSE effect in the adult stage was more pronounced in the lung compared with the liver. For most CpG sites, an inverse correlation was found for promoter methylation and mRNA expression when the data of all three stages were combined. This was more prominent in the liver.

In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at <250 kb from eGene's TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants. CONCLUSIONS: This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at https://helixomics.isglobal.org/ and at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).

Cadmium (Cd) has been associated with smoking -related health e ff ects, and its concentration in tobacco smoke is higher in comparison with other metals. O BJECTIVES : We studied the association of Cd and smoking exposures with human blood DNA methylation (DNAm) pro fi les. We also evaluated the implication of fi ndings to relevant methylation pathways and the potential contribution of Cd exposure from smoking to explain the association between smoking and site -speci fi c DNAm. M ETHODS : We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of urine Cd and self -reported smoking (current and former vs. never, and cumulative smoking dose) with blood DNAm in 790,026 CpGs (methylation sites) measured with the Illumina In fi nium Human MethylationEPIC (Illumina Inc.) platform in 2,325 adults 45 - 74 years of age who participated in the Strong Heart Study in 1989 - 1991. In a mediation analysis, we estimated the amount of change in DNAm associated with smoking that can be independently attributed to increases in urine Cd concentrations from smoking. We also conducted enrichment analyses and in silico protein - protein interaction networks to explore the biological relevance of the fi ndings. R ESULTS : At a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected level of 0.05, we found 6 di ff erentially methylated positions (DMPs) for Cd; 288 and 17, respec- tively, for current and former smoking status; and 77 for cigarette pack -years. Enrichment analyses of these DMPs displayed enrichment of 58 and 6 Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene sets, respectively, including biological pathways for cancer and cardiovascular disease. In in silico protein -to -protein networks, we observed key proteins in DNAm pathways directly and indirectly connected to Cd- and smoking- DMPs. Among DMPs that were signi fi cant for both Cd and current smoking (annotated to PRSS23, AHRR, F2RL3, RARA, and 2q37.1), we found statistically signi fi cant contributions of Cd to smoking -related DNAm. C ONCLUSIONS : Beyond replicating well-known smoking epigenetic signatures, we found novel DMPs related to smoking. Moreover, increases in smoking -related Cd exposure were associated with di ff erential DNAm. Our integrative analysis supports a biological link for Cd and smoking -associated health e ff ects, including the possibility that Cd is partly responsible for smoking toxicity through epigenetic changes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6345","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cadmium,smoking",10.1289/EHP6345,HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE;F2RL3 METHYLATION;OXIDATIVE        STRESS;MATERNAL SMOKING;HEAVY-METALS;EXPOSURE;POPULATION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke,,

Such epigenetic variation could be genetic or non-genetic in origin, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) are underway for a wide variety of diseases/phenotypes. However, performing an EWAS is associated with a range of issues not typically encountered in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), such as the tissue to be analyzed. In many EWASs, it is not possible to analyze the target tissue in large numbers of live humans, and consequently surrogate tissues are employed, most commonly blood. But there is as yet no evidence demonstrating that blood is more informative than buccal cells, the other easily accessible tissue. To assess the potential of buccal cells for use in EWASs, we performed a comprehensive analysis of a buccal cell methylome using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Strikingly, a buccal vs. blood comparison reveals > 6x as many hypomethylated regions in buccal. These tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) are strongly enriched for DNaseI hotspots. Almost 75% of these tDMRs are not captured by commonly used DNA methylome profiling platforms such as Reduced Representational Bisulfite Sequencing and the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and they also display distinct genomic properties. Buccal hypo-tDMRs show a statistically significant enrichment near SNPs associated to disease identified through GWASs. Finally, we find that, compared with blood, buccal hypo-tDMRs show significantly greater overlap with hypomethylated regions in other tissues. We propose that for non-blood based diseases/phenotypes, buccal will be a more informative tissue for EWASs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.4161/epi.24362,DIFFERENTIAL DNA METHYLATION;REVEALS;IDENTIFICATION;SMOKING,,

DNA methylation in white blood cells (WBCs) was associated with total IgE levels in an epigenome-wide association study of white subjects. Whether DNA methylation of eosinophils explains these findings is insufficiently understood.        Methods: We tested for association between genome-wide DNA methylation in WBCs and total IgE levels in 2 studies of Hispanic children: the Puerto Rico Genetics of Asthma and Lifestyle Study (PR-GOAL; n = 306) and the Genes-environments and Admixture in Latino Americans (GALA II) study (n = 573). Whole-genome methylation of DNA from WBCs was measured by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Total IgE levels were measured by using the UniCAP 100 system. InPR-GOALWBCtypes (ie, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) in peripheral blood were measured by using Coulter Counter techniques. In the GALA II study WBC types were imputed. Multivariable linear regression was used for the analysis of DNA methylation and total IgE levels, which was first conducted separately for each cohort, and then results from the 2 cohorts were combined in a meta-analysis.        Results: CpG sites in multiple genes, including novel findings and results previously reported in white subjects, were significantly associated with total IgE levels. However, adjustment for WBC types resulted in markedly fewer significant sites. Top findings from this adjusted meta-analysis were in the genes ZFPM1 (P = 1.5 x 10(-12)), ACOT7 (P = 2.5 x 10(-11)), and MND1 (P = 1.4 x 10(-9)).

The World Trade Center (WTC) responders sustained exposures to potential carcinogens, resulting in an increased risk of cancer. Previous studies of cancer risk in WTC-exposed responders were limited by the deficiency in quantitative and individual information on exposure to carcinogens. The current study introduces a new exposure-ranking index (ERI) for estimating cancer-related acute and chronic exposures, which aimed to improve the ability of future analyses to estimate cancer risk. An epigenome-wide association study based on DNA methylation and a weighted gene co-expression network analysis were carried out to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) sites, modules of correlated CpG sites, and biological pathways associated with the new ERI. Methylation was profiled on blood samples using Illumina 450K Beadchip. No significant epigenome-wide association was found for ERI at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Several cancer-related pathways emerged in pathway analyses for the top ranking genes from epigenome-wide association study as well as enriched module from the weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The current study was the first DNA methylation study that aimed to identify methylation signature for cancer-related exposure in the WTC population. No CpG sites survived multiple testings adjustment. However, enriched gene sets involved in cancer, were identified in both acute and chronic ERIs, supporting the view that multiple genes play a role in this complex exposure.

We undertook a cross-sectional epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of measures of cIMT in 6400 individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis was applied to investigate the potential causal role of DNA methylation in the link between atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors and cIMT or clinical cardiovascular disease. The CpG site cg05575921 was associated with cIMT (beta = -0.0264, p value = 3.5 x 10(-8)) in the discovery panel and was replicated in replication panel (beta = -0.07, p value = 0.005). This CpG is located at chr5:81649347 in the intron 3 of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor gene (AHRR). Our results indicate that DNA methylation at cg05575921 might be in the pathway between smoking, cIMT and stroke. Moreover, in a region-based analysis, 34 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified of which a DMR upstream of ALOX12 showed the strongest association with cIMT (p value = 1.4 x 10(-13)). In conclusion, our study suggests that DNA methylation may play a role in the link between cardiovascular risk factors, cIMT and clinical cardiovascular disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1007/s10654-021-00759-z     EA JUN 2021,HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;DNA METHYLATION;EPIGENETIC        MODIFICATIONS;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;CORONARY EVENTS;BLOOD-PRESSURE;ATHEROSCLEROSIS;INFLAMMATION;GENE;LOCI,,

Despite success in identifying genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, there remains uncertainty about the causal genes involved in disease pathogenesis and how their function is regulated.        Results: We performed a multi-stage epigenome-wide association study, quantifying genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in a total of 1714 individuals from three independent sample cohorts. We have identified multiple differentially methylated positions and regions consistently associated with schizophrenia across the three cohorts; these effects are independent of important confounders such as smoking. We also show that epigenetic variation at multiple loci across the genome contributes to the polygenic nature of schizophrenia. Finally, we show how DNA methylation quantitative trait loci in combination with Bayesian co-localization analyses can be used to annotate extended genomic regions nominated by studies of schizophrenia, and to identify potential regulatory variation causally involved in disease.        Conclusions: This study represents the first systematic integrated analysis of genetic and epigenetic variation in schizophrenia, introducing a methodological approach that can be used to inform epigenome-wide association study analyses of other complex traits and diseases. We demonstrate the utility of using a polygenic risk score to identify molecular variation associated with etiological variation, and of using DNA methylation quantitative trait loci to refine the functional and regulatory variation associated with schizophrenia risk variants. Finally, we present strong evidence for the co-localization of genetic associations for schizophrenia and differential DNA methylation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13059-016-1041-x,METHYLOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;HUMAN BRAIN-TISSUE;CELL-TYPES;GENOTYPE        IMPUTATION;DISEASE;GENOME;RISK;BLOOD;LOCI;INFECTION;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Schizophrenia,,

Using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we investigated differences in blood cell DNA methylation among 50 benzene-exposed subjects and 48 controls, and among 31 formaldehyde-exposed subjects and 40 controls. We performed CpG-level and regional-level analyses. In the benzene EWAS, we found genome-wide significant alterations, i.e., FWER-controlled P-values <0.05, in the mean and variance of methylation at 22 and 318 CpG sites, respectively, and in mean methylation of a large genomic region. Pathway analysis of genes corresponding to benzene-associated differential methylation sites revealed an impact on the AMPK signalling pathway. In formaldehyde-exposed subjects compared to controls, 9 CpGs in the DUSP22 gene promoter had genome-wide significant decreased methylation variability and a large region of the HOXA5 promoter with 44 CpGs was hypomethylated. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases related to benzene and formaldehyde exposure. Aberrant expression and methylation of HOXA5 previously has been shown to be clinically significant in myeloid leukaemias.

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM. Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures. Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites.

Since information on the cell-type composition of the sample is generally not available and methylation profiles are cell-type specific, statistical methods have been developed for adjustment of cell-type heterogeneity in EWAS.        In this study we systematically compared five popular adjustment methods: the factored spectrally transformed linear mixed model (FaST-LMM-EWASher), the sparse principal component analysis algorithm ReFACTor, surrogate variable analysis (SVA), independent SVA (ISVA) and an optimized version of SVA (SmartSVA). We used real data and applied a multilayered simulation framework to assess the type I error rate, the statistical power and the quality of estimated methylation differences according to major study characteristics.        While all five adjustment methods improved false-positive rates compared with unadjusted analyses, FaST-LMM-EWASher resulted in the lowest type I error rate at the expense of low statistical power. SVA efficiently corrected for cell-type heterogeneity in EWAS up to 200 cases and 200 controls, but did not control type I error rates in larger studies. Results based on real data sets confirmed simulation findings with the strongest control of type I error rates by FaST-LMM-EWASher and SmartSVA.

METHODS: An epigenome-wide association study was performed in the Netherlands Twin Register (N = 2258, mean age 37 years), Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (N = 800, age 38 years), and Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (N = 1631, age 18 years), and results were combined through meta-analysis (total sample size N = 4689). Region-based analyses accounting for the correlation between nearby methylation sites were also performed.        RESULTS: One epigenome-wide significant differentially methylated position was detected in the Dunedin study, but meta-analysis did not detect differentially methylated positions that were robustly associated across cohorts. In region-based analyses, six significant differentially methylation regions (DMRs) were identified in the Netherlands Twin Register, 19 in the Dunedin study, and none in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. Of these DMRs, 92% were associated with methylation quantitative trait loci, and 68% showed moderate to large blood-brain correlations for DNA methylation levels. DMRs included six nonoverlapping DMRs (three in the Netherlands Twin Register, three in the Dunedin study) in the major histocompatibility complex, which were associated with expression of genes in the major histocompatibility complex, including C4A and C4B, previously implicated in schizophrenia.

MethodsEpigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina 450K array on whole blood samples of 68 Ghanaians. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were assessed for plasma renin concentration, aldosterone, and ARR using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and technical covariates. Additionally, we extracted methylation loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or that were annotated to RAAS-related genes and associated these with renin and aldosterone concentration. ResultsWe identified one DMP for renin, ten DMPs for aldosterone, and one DMP associated with ARR. Top DMPs were annotated to the PTPRN2, SKIL, and KCNT1 genes, which have been reported in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors, atherosclerosis, and sodium-potassium handling. Moreover, EWAS loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or RAAS-related genes were also associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR. ConclusionIn this first EWAS on RAAS hormones, we identified DMPs associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR in a SSA population. These findings are a first step in understanding the role of DNA methylation in regulation of the RAAS in general and in a SSA population specifically.

However, the underlying mechanisms of how smoking contributes to disease risks are not completely understood. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs), mostly in non-Asian populations, have been conducted to identify smoking-associated methylation alterations at individual probes. There are few data on regional methylation changes in relation to smoking. Few data link differential methylation in blood to differential gene expression in lung tissue.        Results: We identified 108 significant (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and 87 significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (multiple-testing corrected p < 0.01) in current compared to never smokers from our EWAS of cotinine-validated smoking in blood DNA from a Korean chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort (n = 100 including 31 current, 30 former, and 39 never smokers) using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Of the 108 DMPs (FDR < 0.05), nine CpGs were statistically significant based on Bonferroni correction and 93 were novel including five that mapped to loci previously associated with smoking. Of the 87 DMRs, 66 were mapped to novel loci. Methylation correlated with urine cotinine levels in current smokers at six DMPs, with pack-years in current smokers at six DMPs, and with duration of smoking cessation in former smokers at eight DMPs. Of the 143 genes to which our significant DMPs or DMRs annotated, gene expression levels at 20 genes were associated with pack-years in lung tissue transcriptome data of smokers (Asan Biobank, n = 188).        Conclusions: Our study of differential methylation in Koreans confirmed previous findings from non-Asian populations and revealed novel loci in relation to smoking.

The Illumina 450 K DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 340 Ghanaian adults residing in three European cities from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. PD was assessed using sum scores of the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS). Differentially methylated positions and regions (DMPs and DMRs) were identified through linear regression analysis. Two hypo-methylated DMPs, namely cg13986138 (CYFIP1) and cg10316525(ANKRD63), were found to be associated with PD. DMR analysis identified 47 regions associated with the PD. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first EWAS for PD in first generation SSA migrants. We identified two DMPs associated with PD.

While advances in neonatal care have improved survival rates of premature infants, cases of BPD have been increasing with limited therapeutic options for prevention and treatment. This study was designed to explore the relationship between gestational age (GA), birth weight, and estimated blood cell-type composition in premature infants and to elucidate early epigenetic biomarkers associated with BPD.        Methods: Cord blood DNA from preterm neonates that went on to develop BPD (n = 14) or not (non-BPD, n = 93) was applied to Illumina 450 K methylation arrays. Blood cell-type compositions were estimated using DNA methylation profiles. Multivariable robust regression analysis elucidated CpGs associated with BPD risk. cDNA microarray analysis of cord blood RNA identified differentially expressed genes in neonates who later developed BPD.        Results: The development of BPD and the need for oxygen supplementation were strongly associated with GA (BPD, p < 1.0E-04; O-2 supplementation, p < 1.0E-09) and birth weight (BPD, p < 1.0E-02; O-2 supplementation, p < 1.0E-07). The estimated nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) percent was negatively associated with birth weight and GA, positively associated with hypomethylation of the tobacco smoke exposure biomarker cg05575921, and high-NRBC blood samples displayed a hypomethylation profile. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) identified 38 (Bonferroni) and 275 (false discovery rate 1%) differentially methylated CpGs associated with BPD. BPD-associated CpGs in cord blood were enriched for lung maturation and hematopoiesis pathways. Stochastic epigenetic mutation burden at birth was significantly elevated among those who developed BPD (adjusted p= 0.02). Transcriptome changes in cord blood cells reflected cell cycle, development, and pulmonary disorder events in BPD.        Conclusions: While results must be interpreted with caution because of the small size of this study, NRBC content strongly impacted DNA methylation profiles in preterm cord blood and EWAS analysis revealed potential insights into biological pathways involved in BPD pathogenesis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: cord blood,No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-022-01272-0,"RED-BLOOD-CELLS;DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS;CHRONIC LUNG-DISEASE;CORD        BLOOD;MATERNAL SMOKING;REFERENCE VALUES;INCREASED RISK;NEWBORNS;PACKAGE;GENE;Infant, Premature;Infant;Epigenomics",,

This social epigenomics study included long-term childhood cancer survivors enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. DNA methylation (DNAm) data were generated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip, and three social determinants of health (SDOH) factors were assessed: self-reported educational attainment, personal income, and an area deprivation index based on census track data. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed to evaluate the relation between DNAm at each 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) site and each SDOH factor based on multivariable linear regression models stratified by ancestry (European ancestry, n = 1,618; African ancestry, n = 258). EWAS among survivors of European ancestry identified 130 epigenome-wide significant SDOH-CpG associations (P < 9 x 10(-8)), 25 of which were validated in survivors of African ancestry (P < 0.05). Thirteen CpGs were associated with all three SDOH factors and resided at pleiotropic loci in cigarette smoking-related genes (e.g., CLDND1 and CPOX). After accounting for smoking and body mass index, these associations remained significant with attenuated effect sizes. Seven of 13 CpGs were associated with gene expression level based on 57 subsamples with blood RNA sequencing data available. In conclusion, DNAm signatures, many resembling the effect of tobacco use, were associated with SDOH factors among survivors of childhood cancer, thereby suggesting that biologically distal SDOH factors influence health behaviours or related factors, the epigenome, and subsequently survivors' health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: social determinants | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1080/15592294.2022.2030883     EA FEB 2022,LONG-TERM SURVIVORS;COURSE SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;POSITION;STRESS;DISADVANTAGE;INFLAMMATION;OUTCOMES;PROFILE;RISK;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;Survivors,,

Individual responses to a meal high in fat vary greatly, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors. However, only a few loci have been associated with TG-PPL response. Heritable epigenomic changes may be significant contributors to the unexplained inter-individual PPL variability. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on 979 subjects with DNA methylation measured from CD4(+) T cells, who were challenged with a high-fat meal as a part of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study. Eight methylation sites encompassing five genes, LPP, CPT1A, APOA5, SREBF1, and ABCG1, were significantly associated with PPL response at an epigenome-wide level (P < 1.1 x 10(-7)), but no methylation site reached epigenome-wide significance after adjusting for baseline TG levels. Higher methylation at LPP, APOA5, SREBF1, and ABCG1, and lower methylation at CPT1A methylation were correlated with an increased TG-PPL response. These PPL-associated methylation sites, also correlated with fasting TG, account for a substantially greater amount of phenotypic variance (14.9%) in PPL and fasting TG (16.3%) when compared with the genetic contribution of loci identified by our previous genome-wide association study (4.5%). In summary, the epigenome is a large contributor to the variation in PPL, and this has the potential to be used to modulate PPL and reduce CVD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1194/jlr.M069948,LIPID-LOWERING DRUGS;DNA METHYLATION;HEART-DISEASE;BLOOD-LIPIDS;NONFASTING TRIGLYCERIDES;CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE;PLASMA TRIGLYCERIDE;WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE;OBESE SUBJECTS;RISK;Dietary Fats;Epigenomics,,

Elevated serum urate levels, a complex trait and major risk factor for incident gout, are correlated with cardiometabolic traits via incompletely understood mechanisms. DNA methylation in whole blood captures genetic and environmental influences and is assessed in transethnic meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum urate (discovery, n = 12,474, replication, n = 5522). The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p < 1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors.

Multiple genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to its pathogenesis. One of the main environmental risk factors is early life adversity (ELA). Evidence is emerging that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation might play an important role in the biological mechanisms underlying SAD and ELA. To investigate the relationship between ELA, DNA methylation, and SAD, we performed an epigenome-wide association study for SAD and ELA examining DNA from whole blood of a cohort of 143 individuals using DNA methylation arrays. We identified two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with SAD located within the genes SLC43A2 and TNXB. As this was the first epigenome-wide association study for SAD, it is worth noting that both genes have previously been associated with panic disorder. Further, we identified two DMRs associated with ELA within the SLC17A3 promoter region and the SIAH3 gene and several DMRs that were associated with the interaction of SAD and ELA. Of these, the regions within C2CD2L and MRPL28 showed the largest difference in DNA methylation. Lastly, we found that two DMRs were associated with both the severity of social anxiety and ELA, however, neither of them was found to mediate the contribution of ELA to SAD later in life.

Identifying genetic loci where DNA methylation is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation may reveal novel pathways or therapeutic targets for inflammation.        Results: We performed a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a sensitive marker of low-grade inflammation, in a large European population (n = 8863) and trans-ethnic replication in African Americans (n = 4111). We found differential methylation at 218 CpG sites to be associated with CRP (P < 1.15 x 10(-7)) in the discovery panel of European ancestry and replicated (P < 2.29 x 10(-4)) 58 CpG sites (45 unique loci) among African Americans. To further characterize the molecular and clinical relevance of the findings, we examined the association with gene expression, genetic sequence variants, and clinical outcomes. DNA methylation at nine (16%) CpG sites was associated with whole blood gene expression in cis (P < 8.47 x 10(-5)), ten (17%) CpG sites were associated with a nearby genetic variant (P < 2.50 x 10(-3)), and 51 (88%) were also associated with at least one related cardiometabolic entity (P < 9.58x 10(-5)). An additive weighted score of replicated CpG sites accounted for up to 6% inter-individual variation (R-2) of age-adjusted and sex-adjusted CRP, independent of known CRP-related genetic variants.        Conclusion: We have completed an EWAS of chronic low-grade inflammation and identified many novel genetic loci underlying inflammation that may serve as targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for inflammation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13059-016-1119-5,WIDE ASSOCIATION;ATHEROSCLEROSIS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Inflammation;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

The molecular factors linked with LD in PWH are varied and incompletely characterized. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and biomarkers of liver function-aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, albumin, total bilirubin, platelet count, FIB-4 score, and APRI score-in male United States veterans with HIV. Methods: Blood samples and clinical data were obtained from 960 HIV-infected male PWH from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina 450K or the EPIC 850K array in two mutually exclusive subsets. We performed a meta-analysis for each DNAm site measured by either platform. We also examined the associations between four measures of DNAm age acceleration (AA) and liver biomarkers. Results: Nine DNAm sites were positively associated with serum albumin in the meta-analysis of the EPIC and 450K EWAS after correcting for multiple testing. Four DNAm sites (cg16936953, cg18942579, cg01409343, and cg12054453), annotated within the TMEM49 and four of the remaining five sites (cg18181703, cg03546163, cg20995564, and cg23966214) annotated to SOCS3, FKBP5, ZEB2, and SAMD14 genes, respectively. The DNAm site, cg12992827, was not annotated to any known coding sequence. No significant associations were detected for the other six liver biomarkers. Higher PhenoAA was significantly associated with lower level of serum albumin (beta = -0.007, p-value = 8.6 x 10(-4), CI: -0.011116, -0.002884). Conclusion: We identified epigenetic associations of both individual DNAm sites and DNAm AA with liver function through serum albumin in men with HIV.

Long-term effects might be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, yet the literature on this topic is scarce. We performed the first epigenome-wide association study of infant feeding, comparing breastfed vs non-breastfed children. We measured DNA methylation in children from peripheral blood collected in childhood (age 7 years, N = 640) and adolescence (age 15-17 years, N = 709) within the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES) project, part of the larger Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Cord blood methylation (N = 702) was used as a negative control for potential pre-natal residual confounding. Results: Two differentially-methylated sites presented directionally-consistent associations with breastfeeding at ages 7 and 15-17 years, but not at birth. Twelve differentially-methylated regions in relation to breastfeeding were identified, and for three of them there was evidence of directional concordance between ages 7 and 15-17 years, but not between birth and age 7 years. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that DNA methylation in childhood and adolescence may be predicted by breastfeeding, but further studies with sufficiently large samples for replication are required to identify robust associations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: breastfeeding | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.3390/nu12113309,PROMOTING LONGER-TERM;AGE 11.5 YEARS;MATERNAL SMOKING;BLOOD-PRESSURE;EPIGENOME;EPIDEMIOLOGY;EPIGENETICS;REGIONS;OBESITY;CELLS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Longitudinal Studies;Breast Feeding;Methylation,,

While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking.        Results: Here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking.        Conclusions: Estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of nonconstrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s12859-017-1511-5,DNA METHYLATION CHANGES;SYSTEMATIC ANNOTATION;TUMOR PURITY;SUBSETS;DECONVOLUTION;VALIDATION;MICROARRAY;BIOMARKER;PROFILES;EXPOSURE;Algorithms,,

Diet is suggested to affect metabolism and health via epigenetic modifications. Thus, our aim was to explore the association between food consumption and DNA methylation. Methods Epigenome-wide association studies were conducted in three cohorts: KORA FF4, TwinsUK, and Leiden Longevity Study, and 37 dietary exposures were evaluated. Food group definition was harmonized across the three cohorts. DNA methylation was measured using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in KORA and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the Leiden study and the TwinsUK study. Overall, data from 2293 middle-aged men and women were included. A fixed-effects meta-analysis pooled study-specific estimates. The significance threshold was set at 0.05 for false-discovery rate-adjusted p values per food group. Results We identified significant associations between the methylation level of CpG sites and the consumption of onions and garlic (2), nuts and seeds (18), milk (1), cream (11), plant oils (4), butter (13), and alcoholic beverages (27). The signals targeted genes of metabolic health relevance, for example, GLI1, RPTOR, and DIO1, among others.

Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples from 28 MZ twin pairs discordant for RA. DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Smoking, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and immunosuppressive treatment were included as covariates. Pathway analysis was performed using GREAT.        Results: Smoking was significantly associated with hypomethylation of a DMR overlapping the promoter region of the RNF5 and the AGPAT1, which are implicated in inflammation and autoimmunity, whereas DMARD treatment induced hypermethylation of the same region. Additionally, the promotor region of both S100A6 and EFCAB4B were hypomethylated, and both genes have previously been associated with RA.

In addition, atherosclerosis is frequently observed in AD patients indicating common involvement of vascular components in both disease etiologies. Recently, epigenome-wide association studies have identified epigenetic alterations, and in particularly DNA methylation changes for both disorders. We hypothesized the existence of a common DNA methylation profile in atherosclerosis and AD which may be valuable as a blood-based DNA methylation inflammaging biomarker. Using publicly available 450k Illumina methylation datasets, we identified a co-methylation network associated with both atherosclerosis and AD in whole blood samples. This methylation profile appeared to indicate shifts in blood immune cell type distribution. Remarkably, similar methylation changes were also detected in disease tissues, including AD brain tissues, atherosclerotic plaques, and tumors and were found to correlate with immune cell infiltration. In addition, this immune-related methylation profile could also be detected in other inflammaging diseases, including Parkinson's disease and obesity, but not in multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and osteoporosis. In conclusion, we identified a blood-based immune-related DNA methylation signature in multiple inflammaging diseases associated with changes in blood immune cell counts and predictive for immune cell infiltration in diseased tissues. In addition to epigenetic clock measurements, this immune-methylation signature may become a valuable blood-based biomarker to prevent chronic inflammatory disease development or monitor lifestyle intervention strategies which promote healthy aging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.3389/fgene.2019.01229,NEUTROPHIL-LYMPHOCYTE RATIO;ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE;DNA METHYLATION;CEREBROVASCULAR ATHEROSCLEROSIS;CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROSIS;APOLIPOPROTEIN-E;NEUROVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION;EPIGENETIC REGULATION;PERIPHERAL-BLOOD;DEMENTIA;Methylation,,

To fill in this gap, we conducted an integrative two-phase epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of PanC using genomic DNA from 44 cases and 556 controls (20 local controls and 536 public controls in the Framingham Heart Study) in phase 1 and 23 cases and 22 controls in phase 2. We validated the findings using pre-diagnostic blood samples from 13 cases and 26 controls in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We further examined gene expression in peripheral leukocytes of 47 cases and 31 controls involved in the methylation study using RNA sequencing and performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using existing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. In phase 1, we identified 2776 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs) and 154 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In phase 2, we validated six DMPs (in or near AIM2, DGKA, STK39, and TNFSF8) and three DMRs (in or near nc886, LY6G5C, and HLA-DPB1). The DMR near nc886 was further validated in the WHI samples (P = 6.69 x 10(-5)). MR analysis suggested that the CpG sites cg00308130 and cg16684184 for nc886 and cg16875057 for STK39 were causally related to PanC susceptibility and that PanC influenced methylation of cg15354065 for DGKA.

CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p < .003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age-associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p < .003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin production, glucose tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and DNA-regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR.

We examined the association between epigenome-wide DNA methylation and serum cotinine levels as a proxy of nicotine exposure and smoking quantity, assessed the role of SNPs in these associations, and evaluated molecular mediation by methylation in a sample of biochemically verified current smokers (N=310).ResultsDNA methylation at 50 CpG sites was associated (FDR <0.05) with cotinine levels, 17 of which are novel associations. As cotinine levels are influenced not only by nicotine intake but also by CYP2A6-mediated nicotine metabolism rate, we performed secondary analyses adjusting for genetic risk score of nicotine metabolism rate and identified five additional novel associations. We further assessed the potential role of genetic variants in the detected association between methylation and cotinine levels observing 124 cis and 3898 trans methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs). Nineteen of these SNPs were also associated with cotinine levels (FDR <0.05). Further, at seven CpG sites, we observed a trend (P<0.05) that altered DNA methylation mediates the effect of SNPs on nicotine exposure rather than a direct consequence of smoking.

These health challenges are now thought to be reflected in epigenetic modifications to DNA molecules, such as DNA methylation, which can alter gene expression. Methods Here we report the results of three Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) in which we assessed the differential methylation of DNA (obtained from peripheral blood) associated with three adiposity phenotypes (BMI, waist circumference, and impedance-measured percent body fat) among American Indian adult participants in the Strong Heart Study. Results We found differential methylation at 8264 CpG sites associated with at least one of our three response variables. Of the three adiposity proxies we measured, waist circumference had the highest number of associated differentially methylated CpGs, while percent body fat was associated with the lowest. Because both waist circumference and percent body fat relate to physiology, we focused interpretations on these variables. We found a low degree of overlap between these two variables in our gene ontology enrichment and Differentially Methylated Region analyses, supporting that waist circumference and percent body fat measurements represent biologically distinct concepts. Conclusions We interpret these general findings to indicate that highly significant regions of the genome (DMR) and synthesis pathways (GO) in waist circumference analyses are more likely to be associated with the presence of visceral/abdominal fat than more general measures of adiposity. Our findings confirmed numerous CpG sites previously found to be differentially methylated in association with adiposity phenotypes, while we also found new differentially methylated CpG sites and regions not previously identified.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat",10.1038/s41366-020-0646-z     EA JUL 2020,BODY-MASS INDEX;WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE;BIOELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE;OBESITY;BMI;INDIANS;HEALTH;RISK;FAT;OVERWEIGHT;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Phenotype;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. However, no studies to date have identified an epigenetic signature of mammographic density. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of mammographic density. Methods: White blood cell DNA methylation was measured for 385 postmenopausal women using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Differential methylation was assessed using genome-wide, probe-level, and regional analyses. We implemented a resampling-based approach to improve the stability of our findings. Results: On average, women with elevated mammographic density exhibited DNA hypermethylation within CpG islands and gene promoters compared to women with lower mammographic density. We identified 250 CpG sites for which DNA methylation was significantly associated with mammographic density. The top sites were located within genes associated with cancer, including HDLBP, TGFB2, CCT4, and PAX8, and were more likely to be located in regulatory regions of the genome. We also identified differential DNA methylation in 37 regions, including within the promoters of PAX8 and PF4, a gene involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Overall, our results paint a picture of epigenetic dysregulation associated with mammographic density. Conclusion: Mammographic density is associated with differential DNA methylation throughout the genome, including within genes associated with cancer. Our results suggest the potential involvement of several genes in the biological mechanisms behind differences in breast density between women. Further studies are warranted to explore these potential mechanisms and potential links to breast cancer risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1080/15592294.2021.1928994     EA JUN 2021,"BREAST-CANCER RISK;EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;BODY-MASS INDEX;GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA;CARCINOMA IN-SITU;HYPERMETHYLATION;EXPRESSION;TISSUE;CONSUMPTION;CHAPERONIN;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",,

These effects may be mediated, in part, by alterations in DNA methylation. Thus, DNA methylation signatures in peripheral cells may provide biomarkers of the medical impact of alcohol use and the risk for future alcohol consumption. Method Using a high-density methylation array, we characterized epigenome-wide DNA methylation in saliva cells with respect to alcohol consumption in a large cohort of male European American veterans. In this study, DNA methylation of over 870,000 CpG DNA sites was profiled in 1,135 European American men. Alcohol consumption was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C). Linear regression was applied in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), adjusted for confounders. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed in the KEGG database with a correction for gene length. Results We found that a total of 70 CpG sites reached EWAS-corrected significance (p < 6E-08) with small effects on alcohol consumption for individual CpG sites, including 64 new CpG sites and 6 CpG sites that were previously reported as associated with alcohol use disorder, liver function, body mass index, and lipid metabolism. The most significant CpG site was located in SLC7A11 (t = -11.34, p = 2.66E-28), a gene involved specifically in cysteine and glutamate transportation. The 70 significant CpG sites were located on 44 genes, including genes involved in amino acid transport and metabolism systems.

Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have found DNA methylation loci associated with T2D in European populations. However, data from African populations are lacking. We undertook the first EWAS for T2D among sub-Saharan Africans, aiming at identifying ubiquitous and novel DNA methylation loci associated with T2D.        Methods: The Illumine 450k DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 713 Ghanaian participants (256 with T2D, 457 controls) from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for T2D and HbA1c were identified through linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, estimated cell counts, hybridization batch, array position and body mass index (BMI). We also did a candidate analysis of previously reported EWAS loci for T2D in non-African populations, identified through a systematic literature search.        Results: Four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50), cg00574958 (CPT1A), cg07988171 (TPM4)] were associated with T2D after correction for inflation by possible systematic biases. The most strongly associated DMP-cg19693031, TXNIP (P=2.6E-19)-showed hypomethylation in T2D cases compared with controls. Two out of the four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50)] remained associated with T2D after adjustment for BMI, and one locus [cg07988171 (TPM4)] that has not been reported previously.        Conclusions: In this first EWAS for T2D in sub-Saharan Africans, we have identified four DMPs at epigenome-wide level, one of which is novel. These findings provide insight into the epigenetic loci that underlie the burden of T2D in sub-Saharan Africans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/ije/dyy171,DNA METHYLATION;GENOME BROWSER;LOCI;EPIGENETICS;EXPRESSION;NUTRITION;Epigenomics,,

In the bloodstream, soluble TNF receptor II (sTNFR2) can modify the inflammatory response of immune cells and is predictive of cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesize that sTNFR2 is associated with epigenetic modifications of circulating leukocytes, which may relate to the pathophysiology underlying atherogenic risk.        Methods: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of sTNFR2 levels in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort (examination 8; 2005-2008). sTNFR2 was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay and DNA methylation by microarray. The concentration of sTNFR2 was loge-transformed and outliers were excluded. We conducted linear mixed effects models to test the association between sTNFR2 level and methylation at over 400,000 CpGs, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, imputed cell count, technical covariates, and accounting for familial relatedness.        Results: The study sample included 2468 participants (mean age: 67 +/- 9 years, 52% women, mean sTNFR2 level 2661 +/- 1078 pg/ml). After accounting for multiple testing, we identified 168 CpGs (P < 1.2 x 10(-7)) that were differentially methylated in relation to sTNFR2. A substantial proportion (27 CpGs; 16%) are in the major histocompatibility complex region and in loci overrepresented for antigen binding molecular functions (P = 1.7 x 10(-4)) and antigen processing and presentation biological processes (P = 1.3 x 10(-8)). Identified CpGs are enriched in active regulatory regions and associated with expression of 48 cis-genes (+/- 500 kb) in whole blood (P < 1.1 x 10(-5)) that coincide with genes identified in GWAS of diseases of immune dysregulation (inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, IgA nephropathy).

Here, for the first time, we apply an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) approach to identify differentially methylated sites associated with individual differences in WB. Subjects were part of the longitudinal survey studies of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) and participated in the NTR biobank project between 2002 and 2011. WB was assessed by a short inventory that measures satisfaction with life (SAT). DNA methylation was measured in whole blood by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450k array) and the association between WB and DNA methylation level was tested at 411,169 autosomal sites. Two sites (cg10845147, p = 1.51 * 10(-8) and cg01940273, p = 2.34 * 10(-8)) reached genome-wide significance following Bonferonni correction.

We compared estimates of white blood cell type percentages produced by two methods, minfi and differential cell count (DCC), in a birth cohort at two time points (birth and 12 years of age).

Here, we hypothesize that DNA methylation may have an important and potentially independent effect on human metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we conducted what is to the best of our knowledge the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) between DNA methylation and metabolic traits (metabotypes) in human blood. We assess 649 blood metabolic traits from 1814 participants of the Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg (KORA) population study for association with methylation of 457 004 CpG sites, determined on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform. Using the EWAS approach, we identified two types of methylome-metabotype associations. One type is driven by an underlying genetic effect; the other type is independent of genetic variation and potentially driven by common environmental and life-style-dependent factors. We report eight CpG loci at genome-wide significance that have a genetic variant as confounder (P = 3.9 x 10(-20) to 2.0 x 10(-108), r(2) = 0.036 to 0.221). Seven loci display CpG site-specific associations to metabotypes, but do not exhibit any underlying genetic signals (P = 9.2 x 10(-14) to 2.7 x 10(-27), r(2) = 0.008 to 0.107). We further identify several groups of CpG loci that associate with a same metabotype, such as 4-vinylphenol sulfate and 4-androsten-3-beta, 17-beta-diol disulfate. In these cases, the association between CpG-methylation and metabotype is likely the result of a common external environmental factor, including smoking. Our study shows that analysis of EWAS with large numbers of metabolic traits in large population cohorts are, in principle, feasible.

We performed two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) nested in a prospective healthy cohort using the Illumina 450K Methylation Beadchip. The two populations consisted of matched pairs of healthy individuals (n 374), of which half went on to develop breast or colon cancer. The association was analysed between methylation and smoking status, as well as cancer risk. In addition to the same locus in F2RL3, we report several loci that are hypomethylated in smokers compared with former and non-smokers, including an intragenic region of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor gene (AHRR; cg05575921, P 2.31 10(15); effect size 1417), an intergenic CpG island on 2q37.1 (cg21566642, P 3.73 10(13); effect size 12) and a further intergenic region at 6p21.33 (cg06126421, P 4.96 10(11), effect size 78). Bisulphite pyrosequencing validated six loci in a further independent population of healthy individuals (n 180). Methylation levels in AHRR were also significantly decreased (P 0.001) and expression increased (P 0.0047) in the lung tissue of current smokers compared with non-smokers. This was further validated in a mouse model of smoke exposure. We observed an association with breast cancer risk for the 2q37.1 locus (P 0.003, adjusted for the smoking status), but not for the other loci associated with smoking. These data show that smoking has a direct effect on the epigenome in lung tissue, which is also detectable in peripheral blood DNA and may contribute to cancer risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No age/sex adjustment",10.1093/hmg/dds488,HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;DIFFERENTIAL DNA METHYLATION;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;TOBACCO-SMOKING;BREAST;AHRR;SIGNATURE;COHORT;RISK;Smoke,,

However, the cellular effects of these differentially methylated positions (DMPs) are often unclear. Therefore, we investigated top differentially methylated positions identified from an EWAS study. This included a putative regulatory region of NHLRC1. Hypomethylation of this gene was recently linked with decreased survival rates in lung cancer patients. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450K) analysis was performed on 66 lung cancer case-control pairs from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Heidelberg lung cancer EWAS (EPIC HD) cohort. DMPs identified in these pre-diagnostic blood samples were then investigated for differential DNA methylation in lung tumor versus adjacent normal lung tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and replicated in two independent lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue replication sets with MassARRAY. The EPIC HD top hypermethylated DMP cg06646708 was found to be a hypomethylated region in multiple data sets of lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue. Hypomethylation within this region caused increased mRNA transcription of the closest gene NHLRC1 in lung tumors. In functional assays, we demonstrate attenuated proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion upon NHLRC1 knock-down in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, diminished AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 causing expression of pro-apoptotic AKT-repressed genes was detected in these knock-down experiments. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the powerful potential for discovery of novel functional mechanisms in oncogenesis based on EWAS DNA methylation data. NHLRC1 holds promise as a new prognostic biomarker for lung cancer survival and prognosis, as well as a target for novel treatment strategies in lung cancer patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.3390/ijms231810699,FOXO TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS;DNA METHYLATION;E3;CHEMOTHERAPY;DISCOVERY;CISPLATIN;MECHANISM;APOPTOSIS;LEUKEMIA;PATTERNS;Lung Neoplasms;Lung,,

The purpose of the current study was to comprehensively identify CpG sites whose methylation levels were associated with accelerometer-assessed total PA in a general Japanese population. Methods The study participants were from the baseline survey of Saga Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort. PA was objectively measured by a single-axis accelerometer for 7 d. We used a two-stage strategy. In the discovery stage, we performed a meta-analysis of two epigenome-wide association studies of total PA in 898 individuals (a combination of random sample (n = 507) and case-control study sample (n = 391)). Peripheral blood DNA methylation levels were measured using Infinium EPIC or HM450 arrays. In the replication stage, we subsequently examined whether CpG sites significantly associated (P < 1 x 10(-5)) with total PA were replicated in another sample (n = 1711), in which methylation levels were measured by pyrosequencing. A multiple linear regression was performed to determine the cross-sectional association between total PA and methylation levels with adjustment for potential confounders, including body mass index. A fixed-effects model was used in the meta-analysis. Correlations between total PA-associated DNA methylation and several inflammatory markers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, were also conducted. Results In the meta-analysis, nine CpG sites were significantly associated with total PA (P < 1 x 10(-5)). Among the nine sites, one site cg07030336 (annotated to VTI1A/ZDHHC6 gene) was successfully replicated (P = 0.009). Conclusions The current study showed that greater accelerometer-assessed total PA was associated with higher DNA methylation levels at cg07030336 (VTI1A/ZDHHC6) in the general population. In addition, we found a divergent relationship between the methylation levels at cg07030336 and several inflammatory biomarkers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis,physical activity | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Article not accessible",10.1249/MSS.0000000000002970,FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE;EXERCISE;CANCER;INTERLEUKIN-6;INFLAMMATION;ADIPONECTIN;SMOKING;RISK;TIME;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Motor Activity,,

Direct evidence on lung function DNAme is, however, limited. We undertook an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on pre-bronchodilation lung function and its change in adults.        In a discovery-replication EWAS design, DNAme in blood and spirometry were measured twice, 6-15 years apart, in the same participants of three adult population-based discovery cohorts (n=2043). Associated DNAme markers (p<5x10(-7)) were tested in seven replication cohorts (adult: n=3327; childhood: n=420). Technical bias-adjusted residuals of a regression of the normalised absolute beta-values on control probe-derived principle components were regressed on level and change of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and their ratio (FEV1/FVC) in the covariate-adjusted discovery EWAS. Inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses were performed on results from discovery and replication samples in all participants and never-smokers.        EWAS signals were enriched for smoking-related DNAme. We replicated 57 lung function DNAme markers in adult, but not childhood samples, all previously associated with smoking. Markers not previously associated with smoking failed replication. cg05575921 (AHRR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor)) showed the statistically most significant association with cross-sectional lung function (FEV1/FVC: pdiscovery=3.96x10(-21) and pcombined=7.22x10(-50)). A score combining 10 DNAme markers previously reported to mediate the effect of smoking on lung function was associated with lung function (FEV1/FVC: p=2.65x10(-20)).        Our results reveal that lung function-associated methylation signals in adults are predominantly smoking related, and possibly of clinical utility in identifying poor lung function and accelerated decline. Larger studies with more repeat time-points are needed to identify lung function DNAme in never-smokers and in children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1183/13993003.00457-2019,OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE;DNA METHYLATION;SMOKING;BLOOD;Lung;Epigenomics,,

We investigated whether DNA methylation patterns differ between high- vs. low-MBD women who developed BC during an 8.9-year median follow-up in the Florence section of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Methods We analysed 96 pairs of women with BC arising on high- vs. low-MBD breasts (BI-RADS category III-IV vs. I). DNA methylation was determined on pre-diagnostic blood samples using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay. The statistical analysis was conducted by performing an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), by searching differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in gene promoters (followed by functional enrichment and gene annotation analysis); and through a ""candidate pathways"" approach focusing on pre-defined inflammation-related pathways. Results In EWAS, no single CpG site was differentially methylated between high- and low-MBD women after correction for multiple testing. A total of 140 DMRs were identified, of which 131 were hyper- and 9 hypo-methylated amongst high-MBD women. These DMRs encompassed an annotation cluster of 35 genes coding for proteins implicated in transcription regulation and DNA binding. The ""apoptosis signalling"" was the only inflammation-related candidate pathway differentially methylated between high- and low-MBD women. Conclusion Pre-diagnostic methylation patterns differ between high- vs. low-MBD women who subsequently develop BC, particularly, in genes involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and cell apoptosis.

Genetic and epigenetic markers are associated with isocyanate-induced asthma and, before asthma develops, we have shown that genetic polymorphisms are associated with variation in plasma and urine biomarker levels in exposed workers. Inter-individual epigenetic variance may also have a significant role in the observed biomarker variability following isocyanate exposure. Therefore, we determined the percent methylation for CpG islands from DNA extracted from mononuclear blood cells of 24 male spray-painters exposed to 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) monomer and HDI isocyanurate. Spray-painters' personal inhalation and skin exposure to these compounds and the respective biomarker levels of 1,6-diaminohexane (HDA) and trisaminohexyl isocyanurate (TAHI) in their plasma and urine were measured during three repeated industrial hygiene monitoring visits. We controlled for inhalation exposure, skin exposure, age, smoking status, and ethnicity as covariates and performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using likelihood-ratio statistical modeling. We identified 38 CpG markers associated with differences in isocyanate biomarker levels (Bonferroni < 0.05). Annotations for these markers included 18 genes: ALG1, ANKRD11, C16orf89, CHD7, COL27A, FUZ, FZD9, HMGN1, KRT6A, LEPR, MAPK10, MED25, NOSIP, PKD1, SNX19, UNC13A, UROS, and ZFHX3. We explored the functions of the genes that have been published in the literature and used GeneMANIA to investigate gene ontologies and predicted protein-interaction networks. The protein functions of the predicted networks include keratinocyte migration, cell-cell adhesions, calcium transport, neurotransmitter release, nitric oxide production, and apoptosis regulation. Many of the protein pathway functions overlap with previous findings on genetic markers associated with variability both in isocyanate biomarker levels and asthma susceptibility, which suggests there are overlapping protein pathways that contribute to both isocyanate toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. These predicted protein networks can inform future research on the mechanism of allergic airway sensitization by isocyanates and aid in the development of mitigation strategies to better protect worker health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HDI exposure",10.3389/fgene.2021.700636,EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE;DIISOCYANATE-INDUCED ASTHMA;GENETIC-VARIANTS;OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA;CLASS-I;INFLAMMATION;WORKERS;DNA;GENOTYPES;SYNTHASE;Biological Markers;Epigenomics,,

We aimed to identify CpG sites at which DNA methylation levels are associated with blood levels of liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis. METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study in whole blood for liver enzyme levels, including gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), among a discovery set of 731 participants of the Rotterdam Study and sought replication in a non-overlapping sample of 719 individuals. Significant DNA methylation changes were further analyzed to evaluate their relation with hepatic steatosis. Expression levels of the top identified gene were measured in 9 human liver cell lines and compared with expression profiles of its potential targets associated with lipid traits. The candidate gene was subsequently knocked down in human hepatoma cells using lentiviral vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs. RESULTS: Eight probes annotated to SLC7A11, SLC1A5, SLC43A1, PHGDH, PSORS1C1, SREBF1, ANKS3 were associated with GGT and 1 probe annotated to SLC7A11 was associated with ALT after Bonferroni correction (1.0 x 10(-7)). No probe was identified for AST levels. Four probes for GGT levels including cg06690548 (SLC7A11), cg11376147 (SLC43A1), cg22304262 (SLC1A5), and cg14476101 (PHGDH), and 1 for ALT cg06690548 (SLC7A11) were replicated. DNA methylation at SLC7A11 was associated with reduced risk of hepatic steatosis in participants (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI = 0.55-0.93; P value: 2.7 x 10(-3)). In functional experiments, SLC7A11 was highly expressed in human liver cells; its expression is positively correlated with expression of a panel of lipid-associated genes, indicating a role of SLC7A11 in lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insights into epigenetic mechanisms associated with markers of liver function and hepatic steatosis, laying the groundwork for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1053/j.gastro.2017.06.003,GAMMA-GLUTAMYL-TRANSFERASE;LIPID-LOWERING DRUGS;BODY-MASS INDEX;DIET        NETWORK;HUMAN GENOME;METAANALYSIS;RISK;EPIGENETICS;DISEASE;BLOOD;Liver;Methylation,,

DNA methylation (DNAm) may provide insight into mechanisms underlying these relationships. We hypothesized that DNAm would differ among older individuals who are more versus less optimistic.MethodsUsing cross-sectional data from two population-based cohorts of women with diverse races/ethnicities (n = 3816) and men (only White, n = 667), we investigated the associations of optimism with epigenome-wide leukocyte DNAm. Random-effects meta-analyses were subsequently used to pool the individual results. Significantly differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) were identified by the ""number of independent degrees of freedom"" approach: effective degrees of freedom correction using the number of principal components (PCs), explaining >95% of the variation of the DNAm data (PC-correction). We performed regional analyses using comb-p and pathway analyses using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.ResultsWe found that essentially all CpGs (total probe N = 359,862) were homogeneous across sex and race/ethnicity in the DNAm-optimism association. In the single CpG site analyses based on homogeneous CpGs, we identified 13 significantly differentially methylated probes using PC-correction. We found four significantly differentially methylated regions and two significantly differentially methylated pathways. The annotated genes from the single CpG site and regional analyses are involved in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and cancer.

Plain language summaryCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Previous studies have found that genetics incompletely explain susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. To find new potential risk factors, the authors investigated the possible contribution of DNA methylation (modifications to DNA that can affect gene expression but do not alter the underlying genetic code) in an adult population on the Croatian island of Hvar, which has a high number of people with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. By examining DNA methylation in blood collected at two time points, 10 years apart, the authors were able to identify DNA methylation that either stayed the same over time (stable) or changed the most over time (dynamic). These were then compared with clinical test results related to cardiovascular or metabolic diseases to determine if they are associated. Twenty-two methylation sites were found to be associated with systolic blood pressure. Of those, 20 were considered stable and two were dynamic. Additionally, there was one stable methylation site associated with serum calcium and one with C-reactive protein. These findings suggest that systolic blood pressure may be regulated through stable DNA methylation that is potentially established earlier in life.        Background: The objective was to identify stable and dynamic DNA methylation loci associated with cardiometabolic traits among an adult population from the Croatian island of Hvar. Materials & methods: An epigenome-wide association study was conducted using peripheral blood longitudinally collected at two time points 10 years apart via Infinium MethylationEPIC beadarray (n = 112). Stable and dynamic loci were identified using linear mixed models. Associations between cardiometabolic traits and loci were assessed using linear models. Results: 22 CpG loci were significantly associated with systolic blood pressure. Twenty were stable and two were dynamic. Conclusion: Multiple genes may be involved in the determination of systolic blood pressure level via stable epigenetic programming, potentially established earlier in life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.2217/epi-2022-0279     EA DEC 2022,METABOLIC SYNDROME;ADRIATIC ISLAND;TRAITS;BEHAVIOR;DISEASES;COMPLEX;ACINUS;RISKS;Methylation;Blood Pressure,,

Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities.        Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients <= 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitaliza-tion and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients.        Findings: The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candi-dates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease.        Interpretation: We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic factors, could be useful in the clinical stratification and management of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.

However, whether similar DNA methylation patterns are associated with childhood and adolescent body mass index (BMI) is largely unknown. More insight into this relationship at younger ages may have implications for future prevention of obesity and its related traits. Methods We examined whether DNA methylation in cord blood and whole blood in childhood and adolescence was associated with BMI in the age range from 2 to 18 years using both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. We performed meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies including up to 4133 children from 23 studies. We examined the overlap of findings reported in previous studies in children and adults with those in our analyses and calculated enrichment. Results DNA methylation at three CpGs (cg05937453, cg25212453, and cg10040131), each in a different age range, was associated with BMI at Bonferroni significance, P < 1.06 x 10(-7), with a 0.96 standard deviation score (SDS) (standard error (SE) 0.17), 0.32 SDS (SE 0.06), and 0.32 BMI SDS (SE 0.06) higher BMI per 10% increase in methylation, respectively. DNA methylation at nine additional CpGs in the cross-sectional childhood model was associated with BMI at false discovery rate significance. The strength of the associations of DNA methylation at the 187 CpGs previously identified to be associated with adult BMI, increased with advancing age across childhood and adolescence in our analyses. In addition, correlation coefficients between effect estimates for those CpGs in adults and in children and adolescents also increased. Among the top findings for each age range, we observed increasing enrichment for the CpGs that were previously identified in adults (birth P-enrichment = 1; childhood P-enrichment = 2.00 x 10(-4); adolescence P-enrichment = 2.10 x 10(-7)). Conclusions There were only minimal associations of DNA methylation with childhood and adolescent BMI. With the advancing age of the participants across childhood and adolescence, we observed increasing overlap with altered DNA methylation loci reported in association with adult BMI. These findings may be compatible with the hypothesis that DNA methylation differences are mostly a consequence rather than a cause of obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat,Meta-analysis",10.1186/s13073-020-00810-w,CORD BLOOD;PROMOTER METHYLATION;LMS METHOD;OBESITY;ADIPOSITY;CHILDHOOD;DISCOVERY;CHILDREN;LOCI;VALIDATION;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Adolescent;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation;Body Mass Index,,

We analysed DNA methylation in paired cord blood and placenta samples among 437 newborns from Gen3G, a pre-birth prospective cohort of primarily European descent. We measured DNA methylation in both tissues across the genome in >720,000 CpG sites using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. At each site, we used linear mixed models (LMMs) with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix to test for an association between maternal early-pregnancy BMI and DNA methylation in both tissues (modelled as M-values). We adjusted for tissue-specific covariates, offspring sex, gestational age at delivery, and maternal smoking and age. Women had a mean (SD) BMI of 25.4 (5.7) kg/m(2) measured at first trimester visit (mean=9.9 weeks).

DNA methylation is highly influenced by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, which is causally related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. To date, there have been few large-scale, combined analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression and their interrelations with lung diseases.        Results: We performed an epigenome-wide association study of whole blood gene expression in -6000 individuals from four cohorts. We discovered and replicated numerous CpGs associated with the expression of cis genes within 500 kb of each CpG, with 148 to 1,741 cis CpG-transcript pairs identified across cohorts. We found that the closer a CpG resided to a transcription start site, the larger its effect size, and that 36% of cis CpG-transcript pairs share the same causal genetic variant. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that hypomethylation and lower expression of CHRNA5, which encodes a smoking-related nicotinic receptor, are causally linked to increased risk of COPD and lung cancer. This putatively causal relationship was further validated in lung tissue data.        Conclusions: Our results provide a large and comprehensive association study of whole blood DNA methylation with gene expression. Expression platform differences rather than population differences are critical to the replication of cis CpG-transcript pairs. The low reproducibility of trans CpG-transcript pairs suggests that DNA methylation regulates nearby rather than remote gene expression. The putatively causal roles of methylation and expression of CHRNA5 in relation to COPD and lung cancer provide evidence for a mechanistic link between patterns of smoking-related epigenetic variation and lung diseases, and highlight potential therapeutic targets for lung diseases and smoking cessation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-021-01041-5,Gene Expression;Lung;Smoke;Smoking,,

Nonetheless, the role of DNA methylation in cadmium-related health effects has yet to be determined. To this end, we investigated the relationship between prenatal cadmium exposure and cord blood DNA methylation in Korean infants through an epigenome-wide association study. Cadmium concentrations in maternal blood during early and late pregnancy and in cord blood collected from newborns were measured using atomic adsorption spectrometry and DNA methylation analysis was conducted using HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip kits. After adjusting for infant sex, maternal pregnancy body mass index, smoking status, and estimated leukocyte composition, we analyzed the association between CpG methylation and cadmium concentration in 364 samples. Among 835,252 CpG sites, maternal blood cadmium concentration in early pregnancy was significantly associated with two differentially methylated CpG sites, cg05537752 and cg24904393, which were annotated ATP9A and no gene, respectively. The study findings indicate that prenatal cadmium exposure is significantly associated with methylation statuses of several CpG sites and regions in Korean infants, especially during early pregnancy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1016/j.envres.2022.113268     EA APR 2022,"MATERNAL SMOKING;NEURODEVELOPMENT;DECONVOLUTION;DEFICIENCY;NEWBORNS;METALS;LEAD;AGE;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Fetal Blood;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA",,

However, the epigenomic footprint underpinning IgE-mediated type-I hypersensitivity has not been well-understood, especially under a longitudinal early-childhood life-course framework.        Methods: We used epigenome-wide DNA methylation (IlluminaHumanMethylation450 BeadChip) in cord blood and mid-childhood peripheral blood to investigate pre- and post-natal methylation marks associated with mid-childhood (age 6.7-10.2) total serum IgE levels in 217 mother-child pairs in Project Viva-a prospective longitudinal pre-birth cohort in eastern Massachusetts, USA. We identified methylation sites associated with IgE using covariate-adjusted robust linear regressions.        Results: Nineteen methylation marks in cord blood were associated with IgE in mid-childhood (FDR < 0.05) in genes implicated in cell signaling, growth, and development Among these, two methylation sites (C7orf50, ZAR1) remained robust after the adjustment for the change in DNA methylation from birth to mid-childhood (FDR < 0.05). An analysis of the change in methylation between cord blood and mid-childhood DNA (Delta-DNAm) identified 395 methylation marks in 272 genes associated with mid-childhood IgE (FDR < 0.05), with multiple sites located within ACOT7 (4 sites), EPX (5 sites), EVL (3 sites), KSR1 (4 sites), ZFPM1 (3 sites), and ZNF862 (3 sites). Several of these methylation loci were previously associated with asthma (ADAM19, EPX, IL4, IL5RA, and PRG2).        Conclusion: This study identified fetally programmed and mid-childhood methylation signals associated with mid-childhood IgE.

Methods: First, we used cord blood of 129 Dutch children exposed to maternal smoking vs 126 unexposed to maternal and paternal smoking (53% male) participating in the GECKO Drenthe birth cohort. DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. We performed an epigenome-wide association study for the association between maternal smoking and methylation followed by a mediation analysis of the top signals [false-discovery rate (FDR)<0.05]. We adjusted both analyses for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, offspring's sex, gestational age and white blood cell composition. Secondly, in 175 exposed and 1248 unexposed newborns from two independent birth cohorts, we replicated and meta-analysed results of eight cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in the GFI1 gene, which showed the most robust mediation. Finally, we performed functional network and enrichment analysis.        Results: We found 35 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR<0.05) in newborns exposed vs unexposed to smoking, of which 23 survived Bonferroni correction (P<1 x 10(-7)). These 23 CpGs mapped to eight genes: AHRR, GFI1, MYO1G, CYP1A1, NEUROG1, CNTNAP2, FRMD4A and LRP5. We observed partial confirmation as three of the eight CpGs in GFI1 replicated. These CpGs partly mediated the effect of maternal smoking on birthweight (Sobel P<0.05) in meta-analysis of GECKO and the two replication cohorts. Differential methylation of these three GFI1 CpGs explained 12-19% of the 202 g lower birthweight in smoking mothers. Functional enrichment analysis pointed towards activation of cell-mediated immunity.        Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with cord blood methylation differences. We observed a potentially mediating role of methylation in the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and birthweight of the offspring. Functional network analysis suggested a role in activating the immune system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,No environmental factor",10.1093/ije/dyv048,GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;GENE-EXPRESSION;PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN;TOBACCO-SMOKE;EXPOSURE;RISK;IDENTIFICATION;EPIGENETICS;OVERWEIGHT;DISCOVERY;Pregnancy;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

OBJECTIVE To scan genome-wide DNA methylation data to identify differentially methylated CpGs between SZ cases and controls.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Epigenome-wide association study begun in 2008 using DNA methylation levels of 456 513 CpG loci measured on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array (Illumina) in a consortium of case-control studies for initial discovery and in an independent replication set. Primary analyses used general linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, batch, and cell type heterogeneity. The discovery set contained 689 SZ cases and 645 controls (n = 1334), from 3 multisite consortia: the Consortium on the Genetics of Endophenotypes in Schizophrenia, the Project among African-Americans To Explore Risks for Schizophrenia, and the Multiplex Multigenerational Family Study of Schizophrenia. The replication set contained 247 SZ cases and 250 controls (n = 497) from the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort.        MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Identification of differentially methylated positions across the genome in SZ cases compared with controls.        RESULTS Of the 689 case participants in the discovery set, 477 (69%) were men and 258 (37%) were non-African American; of the 645 controls, 273 (42%) were men and 419 (65%) were non-African American. In our replication set, cases/controls were 76% male and 100% non-African American. We identified SZ-associated methylation differences at 923 CpGs in the discovery set (false discovery rate, <0.2). Of these, 625 showed changes in the same direction including 172 with P < .05 in the replication set. Some replicated differentially methylated positions are located in a top-ranked SZ region from genome-wide association study analyses.        CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This analysis identified 172 replicated new associations with SZ after careful correction for cell type heterogeneity and other potential confounders. The overlap with previous genome-wide association study data can provide potential insights into the functional relevance of genetic signals for SZ.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.0144,HUMAN BRAIN-TISSUE;OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS;PREFRONTAL CORTEX;EXPRESSION;PROTEIN;BLOOD;RISK;DISEASE;GENES;RESISTANCE;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Schizophrenia;Methylation,,

We hypothesized that a woman's total lifetime estrogen exposure accumulates changes in DNA methylation, detectable in the blood, which could be used in risk assessment for breast cancer.MethodsAn estimated lifetime estrogen exposure (ELEE) model was defined using epidemiological data from EPIC-Italy (n=31,864). An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of ELEE was performed using existing Illumina HumanMethylation450K Beadchip (HM450K) methylation data obtained from EPIC-Italy blood DNA samples (n=216). A methylation index (MI) of ELEE based on 31 CpG sites was developed using HM450K data from EPIC-Italy and the Generations Study and evaluated for association with breast cancer risk in an independent dataset from the Generations Study (n=440 incident breast cancer cases matched to 440 healthy controls) using targeted bisulfite sequencing. Lastly, a meta-analysis was conducted including three additional cohorts, consisting of 1187 case-control pairs.ResultsWe observed an estimated 5% increase in breast cancer risk per 1-year longer ELEE (OR=1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.07, P=3x10(-12)) in EPIC-Italy. The EWAS identified 694 CpG sites associated with ELEE (FDR Q<0.05). We report a DNA methylation index (MI) associated with breast cancer risk that is validated in the Generations Study targeted bisulfite sequencing data (ORQ4_vs_Q1=1.77, 95% CI 1.07-2.93, P=0.027) and in the meta-analysis (ORQ4_vs_Q1=1.43, 95% CI 1.05-2.00, P=0.024); however, the correlation between the MI and ELEE was not validated across study cohorts.ConclusionWe have identified a blood DNA methylation signature associated with breast cancer risk in this study.

However, associations between intake of these nutrients and genome-wide DNA methylation levels have not been studied comprehensively in humans.        Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether folate and/or vitamin B-12 intake are asssociated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in leukocytes.        Methods: A large-scale epigenome-wide association study of folate and vitamin B-12 intake was performed on DNA from 5841 participants from 10 cohorts using Illumina 450k arrays. Folate and vitamin B-12 intakes were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Continuous and categorical (low compared with high intake) linear regression mixed models were applied per cohort, controlling for confounders. A meta-analysis was performed to identify significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs), and a pathway analysis was performed on the DMR annotated genes.        Results: The categorical model resulted in 6 DMPs, which are all negatively associated with folate intake, annotated to FAM64A, WRAP73, FRMD8, CUX1, and LCN8 genes, which have a role in cellular processes including centrosome localization, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Regional analysis showed 74 folate-associated DMRs, of which 73 were negatively associated with folate intake. The most significant folate-associated DMR was a 400-base pair (bp) spanning region annotated to the LGALS3BP gene. In the categorical model, vitamin B-12 intake was associated with 29 DMRs annotated to 48 genes, of which the most significant was a 1100-bp spanning region annotated to the calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated gene (CABYR). Vitamin B-12 intake was not associated with DMPs.        Conclusions: We identified novel epigenetic loci that are associated with folate and vitamin B-12 intake. Interestingly, we found a negative association between folate and DNA methylation.

In longitudinal analyses of DNA methylation in peripheral blood and buccal cells from children (N = 1737), we observed moderately stable associations across age (correlation range [0.355-0.578]), but inconsistent across tissues (correlation range [- 0.384 to 0.318]). We conclude that DNA methylation in peripheral tissues captures little of the variance in handedness. Future investigations should consider other more targeted sources of tissue, such as the brain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: handedness | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1038/s41598-022-08998-0,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;MATERNAL SMOKING;HAND PREFERENCE;GENE;ASYMMETRY;REVEALS;BIRTH;METAANALYSIS;PREGNANCY;ORIGINS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Functional Laterality;Methylation;DNA;DNA Methylation,,

Health risks persist after As exposure has ended, suggesting epigenetic dysregulation as a mechanistic link between exposure and health outcomes. O BJECTIVES : We investigated the association between total urinary As and locus -speci fi c DNA methylation in the Strong Heart Study, a cohort of American Indian adults with low -to -moderate As exposure [total urinary As, mean ? ?SD ? lg / g creatinine: 11.7 (10.6)]. M ETHODS : DNA methylation was measured in 2,325 participants using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We implemented linear models to test di ff erentially methylated positions (DMPs) and the DMRcate method to identify regions (DMRs) and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis. Models were adjusted for estimated cell type proportions, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, estimated glomerular fi ltration rate, and study center. Arsenic was measured in urine as the sum of inorganic and methylated species. R ESULTS : In adjusted models, methylation at 20 CpGs was associated with urinary As after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR < 0 . 05). After Bonferroni correction, 5 CpGs remained associated with total urinary As ( p Bonferroni < 0 . 05), located in SLC7A11 , ANKS3 , LINGO3 , CSNK1D , ADAMTSL4 . We identi fi ed one DMR on chromosome 11 (chr11:2,322,050-2,323,247), annotated to C11orf2 ; TSPAN32 genes.

The top DMP was located in SLC7A11A , a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As -induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism. Further research is needed, including research in more diverse populations, to investigate whether As -related DNA methylation signatures are associated with gene expression or may serve as biomarkers of disease development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6263","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: arsenic exposure",10.1289/EHP6263,UMBILICAL-CORD BLOOD;CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE;AMERICAN-INDIANS;DOSE-RESPONSE;EARLY-LIFE;GLUTATHIONE;PACKAGE;POPULATION;EXPRESSION;PLACENTA;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Methylation;Arsenicals;Arsenates,,

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, regulate gene expression throughout development and adulthood, and may mediate genetic and environmental effects on complex traits. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify regions in the genome where DNA methylation level is associated with aggressive behavior. Subjects took part in longitudinal survey studies from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) and participated in the NTR biobank project between 2004 and 2011 (N = 2,029, mean age at blood sampling = 36.4 years, SD = 12.4, females = 69.2%). Aggressive behavior was rated with the ASEBA Adult Self-Report (ASR). DNA methylation was measured in whole blood by the Illumina HM450k array. The association between aggressive behavior and DNA methylation level at 411,169 autosomal sites was tested. Association analyses in the entire cohort showed top sites at cg01792876 (chr8; 116,684,801, nearest gene = TRPS1, p = 7.6 x 10(-7), False discovery rate (FDR) = 0.18) and cg06092953 (chr18; 77,905,699, nearest gene = PARD6G-AS1, p = 9.0 x10(-7), FDR = 0.18).

Maternal smoking also has been linked to altered fetal DNA methylation (DNAm). However, what remains largely unexplored is whether these DNAm alterations are merely markers of smoking exposure or if they also have implications for health outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that fetal DNAm mediates the effect of maternal smoking on newborn birthweight. Methods This study included mother-newborn pairs from a US predominantly urban, low-income multi-ethnic birth cohort. DNAm in cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After standard quality control and normalization procedures, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of maternal smoking was performed using linear regression models, controlling for maternal age, education, race, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, alcohol consumption, gestational age, maternal pregestational/gestational diabetes, child sex, cord blood cell compositions and batch effects. To quantify the degree to which cord DNAm mediates the smoking-birthweight association, the VanderWeele-Vansteelandt approach for single mediator and structural equational model for multiple mediators were used, adjusting for pertinent covariates. Results The study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Among mothers, 165 (17.3%) ever smoked before or during pregnancy. Newborns with smoking exposure had on average 258 g lower birthweight than newborns without exposure (P < 0.001). Using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as the significance cutoff, the EWAS identified 38 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with maternal smoking. Of those, 17 CpG sites were mapped to previously reported genes: GFI1, AHRR, CYP1A1, and CNTNAP2; 8 of those, located in the first three genes, were Bonferroni significantly associated with newborn birthweight and mediated the smoking-birthweight association. The combined mediation effect of the three genes explained 67.8% of the smoking-birthweight association. Conclusions Our study not only lends further support that maternal smoking alters fetal DNAm in a multiethnic population, but also suggests that fetal DNAm substantially mediates the maternal smoking-birthweight association. Our findings, if further validated, indicate that DNAm modification is likely an important pathway by which maternal smoking impairs fetal growth and, perhaps, even long-term health outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1186/s13148-021-01032-6,"EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS;CORD BLOOD;PREGNANCY;RISK;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Infant, Newborn;Cohort Studies;Smoke;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation",,

The underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of AUD are largely unknown; however, growing evidence suggests that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with alterations in DNA methylation. Identification of alcohol-associated methylomic variation might provide novel insights into pathophysiology and novel treatment targets for AUD. Here we performed the largest single-cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption to date (N = 8161) and cross-validated findings in AUD populations with relevant endophenotypes, as well as alcohol-related animal models. Results showed 2504 CpGs significantly associated with alcohol consumption (Bonferroni p value < 6.8 x 10(-8)) with the five leading probes located in SLC7A11 (p = 7.75 x 10(-108)), JDP2 (p = 1.44 x 10(-56)), GAS5 (p = 2.71 x 10(-47)), TRA2B (p = 3.54 x 10(-42)), and SLC43A1 (p = 1.18 x 10(-40)). Genes annotated to associated CpG sites are implicated in liver and brain function, the cellular response to alcohol and alcohol-associated diseases, including hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Two-sample Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship of consumption on AUD risk (inverse variance weighted (IVW) p = 5.37 x 10(-09)). A methylation-based predictor of alcohol consumption was able to discriminate AUD cases in two independent cohorts (p = 6.32 x 10(-38) and p = 5.41 x 10(-14)). The top EWAS probe cg06690548, located in the cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11, was replicated in an independent cohort of AUD and control participants (N = 615) and showed strong hypomethylation in AUD (p < 10(-17)). Decreased CpG methylation at this probe was consistently associated with clinical measures including increased heavy drinking days (p < 10(-4)), increased liver function enzymes (GGT (p = 1.03 x 10(-21)), ALT (p = 1.29 x 10(-6)), and AST (p = 1.97 x 10(-8))) in individuals with AUD. Postmortem brain analyses documented increased SLC7A11 expression in the frontal cortex of individuals with AUD and animal models showed marked increased expression in liver, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol leads to hypomethylation-induced overexpression of SLC7A11. Taken together, our EWAS discovery sample and subsequent validation of the top probe in AUD suggest a strong role of abnormal glutamate signaling mediated by methylomic variation in SLC7A11. Our data are intriguing given the prominent role of glutamate signaling in brain and liver and might provide an important target for therapeutic intervention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: alcohol",10.1038/s41380-021-01378-6     EA DEC 2021,NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY;DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS;BLOOD-PRESSURE;MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION;DSM-IV;PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOL;WITHDRAWAL;REVEALS;RISK;METAANALYSIS;Alcoholics,,

The effect of ionizing radiations (IRs) is well known regarding their ability to induce genetic alterations; however, their impact on the epigenome landscape in cancer, notably at the CpG dinucleotide resolution, remains to be further deciphered. In addition, no evidence is available regarding the effect of IRs on the DNA methylome profile according to the methionine dependency phenotype, which represents a hallmark of metabolic adaptation in cancer.        Methods: We used a case-control study design with a fractionated irradiation regimen on four cancerous cell lines representative of HCC (HepG2), melanoma (MeWo and MeWo-LC1, which exhibit opposed methionine dependency phenotypes), and glioblastoma (U251). We performed high-resolution genome-wide DNA methylome profiling using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip on baseline conditions, irradiated cell lines (cumulative dose of 10 Gy), and non-irradiated counterparts. We performed epigenome-wide association studies to assess the effect of IRs and methionine-dependency-oriented analysis by carrying out epigenome-wide conditional logistic regression. We looked for epigenome signatures at the locus and single-probe (CpG dinucleotide) levels and through enrichment analyses of gene ontologies (GO). The EpiMet project was registered under the ID#AAP-BMS_003_211.        Results: EWASs revealed shared GO annotation pathways associated with increased methylation signatures for several biological processes in response to IRs, including blood circulation, plasma membrane-bounded cell projection organization, cell projection organization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and animal organ morphogenesis. Epigenome-wide conditional logistic regression analysis on the methionine dependency phenotype highlighted several epigenome signatures related to cell cycle and division and responses to IR and ultraviolet light.        Conclusions: IRs generated a variation in the methylation level of a high number of CpG probes with shared biological pathways, including those associated with cell cycle and division, responses to IRs, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and metastasis. These results provide insight on shared adaptive mechanisms of the epigenome in cancerous cell lines in response to IR. Future experiments should focus on the tryptic association between IRs, the initiation of a radioresistance phenotype, and their interaction with methionine dependency as a hallmark of metabolic adaptation in cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: radiation",10.1186/s13148-021-01199-y,EPIGENETIC DNA METHYLATION;RECOMBINANT METHIONINASE;HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA;GENE-EXPRESSION;THERAPY;RADIOTHERAPY;BIOLOGY;TARGET;GROWTH;Methionine;Cell Line,,

Methods Our approach combined the analysis of placenta epigenomic (ENCODE) data with newly generated DNA methylation data obtained from 568 pregnant women, the largest cohort to date, either actively smoking during their pregnancy or formerly exposed to tobacco smoking. Results This strategy resulted in several major findings. First, among the 203 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified by the epigenome-wide association study, 152 showed ""reversible"" alterations of DNA methylation, only present in the placenta of current smokers, whereas 26 were also found altered in former smokers, whose placenta had not been exposed directly to cigarette smoking. Although the absolute methylation changes were smaller than those observed in other contexts, such as in some congenital diseases, the observed alterations were consistent within each DMR. This observation was further supported by a demethylation ofLINE-1sequences in the placentas of both current (beta-coefficient (beta) (95% confidence interval (CI)), - 0.004 (- 0.008; 0.001)) and former smokers (beta(95% CI), - 0.006 (- 0.011; - 0.001)) compared to nonsmokers. Second, the 203 DMRs were enriched in epigenetic marks corresponding to enhancer regions, including monomethylation of lysine 4 and acetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (respectively H3K4me1 and H3K27ac). Third, smoking-associated DMRs were also found near and/or overlapping 10 imprinted genes containing regions (corresponding to 16 genes), notably including theNNAT,SGCE/PEG10, andH19/MIR675loci. Conclusions Our results pointing towards genomic regions containing the imprinted genes as well as enhancers as preferential targets suggest mechanisms by which tobacco could directly impact the fetus and future child. The persistence of significant DNA methylation changes in the placenta of former smokers supports the hypothesis of an ""epigenetic memory"" of exposure to cigarette smoking before pregnancy.

Currently, few studies have been done to identify metastable DNA methylation biomarkers associated with longitudinal lung function decline in humans. The identification of such biomarkers is important for screening vulnerable populations. We hypothesized that quantifiable blood-based DNA methylation alterations would serve as metastable biomarkers of lung function decline and aging, which may help to discover new pathways and/or mechanisms related to pulmonary pathogenesis. Using linear mixed models, we performed an Epigenome Wide Association Study (EWAS) between DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides and longitudinal lung function (FVC, FEV1, FEF25-75%) decline and aging with initial discovery in the Normative Aging Study, and replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg cohort. We identified two metastable epigenetic loci associated with either poor lung function and aging, cg05575921 (AHRR gene), or lung function independently of aging, cg06126421 (IER3 gene).

Chromatin modifications are particularly labile, providing a mechanism for organisms to respond and adapt to environmental cues. Results from studies in animal models clearly demonstrate that epigenomic variability leads to phenotypic variability, including susceptibility to disease that is not recognized at the DNA sequence level. Thus, capturing epigenomic information is invaluable for comprehensively understanding development, differentiation, and disease.

We did an epigenome-wide association study to assess methylation profiles associated with childhood asthma.        Methods We did a large-scale epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) within the Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL) project. We examined epigenome-wide methylation using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChips (450K) in whole blood in 207 children with asthma and 610 controls at age 4-5 years, and 185 children with asthma and 546 controls at age 8 years using a cross-sectional case-control design. After identification of differentially methylated CpG sites in the discovery analysis, we did a validation study in children (4-16 years; 247 cases and 2949 controls) from six additional European cohorts and meta-analysed the results. We next investigated whether replicated CpG sites in cord blood predict later asthma in 1316 children. We subsequently investigated cell-type-specific methylation of the identified CpG sites in eosinophils and respiratory epithelial cells and their related gene-expression signatures. We studied cell-type specificity of the asthma association of the replicated CpG sites in 455 respiratory epithelial cell samples, collected by nasal brushing of 16-year-old children as well as in DNA isolated from blood eosinophils (16 with asthma, eight controls [age 2-56 years]) and compared this with whole-blood DNA samples of 74 individuals with asthma and 93 controls (age 1-79 years). Whole-blood transcriptional profiles associated with replicated CpG sites were annotated using RNA-seq data of subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.        Findings 27 methylated CpG sites were identified in the discovery analysis. 14 of these CpG sites were replicated and passed genome-wide significance (p<1 . 14 x 10(-7)) after meta-analysis. Consistently lower methylation levels were observed at all associated loci across childhood from age 4 to 16 years in participants with asthma, but not in cord blood at birth. All 14 CpG sites were significantly associated with asthma in the second replication study using whole-blood DNA, and were strongly associated with asthma in purified eosinophils. Whole-blood transcriptional signatures associated with these CpG sites indicated increased activation of eosinophils, effector and memory CD8 T cells and natural killer cells, and reduced number of naive T cells. Five of the 14 CpG sites were associated with asthma in respiratory epithelial cells, indicating cross-tissue epigenetic effects.        Interpretation Reduced whole-blood DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites acquired after birth was strongly associated with childhood asthma. These CpG sites and their associated transcriptional profiles indicate activation of eosinophils and cytotoxic T cells in childhood asthma. Our findings merit further investigations of the role of epigenetics in a clinical context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30052-3,GENOMEWIDE ASSOCIATION;PHENOTYPES;CHILDREN;COHORT;IGE;POPULATION;COLLECTION;EXPOSURE;RHINITIS;IMMUNITY;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Asthma;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

However, there is no methodology to estimate the proportion of cell types in umbilical cord blood (also a heterogeneous tissue) used in EWAS.        Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in umbilical cord blood are the result of blood cell type proportion changes that typically occur across gestational age and to demonstrate the effect of cell type proportion confounding by comparing preterm infants exposed and not exposed to antenatal steroids.        Methods: We obtained DNAm profiles of cord blood using the Illumina HumanMethylation27k BeadChip array for 385 neonates from the Boston Birth Cohort. We estimated cell type proportions for six cell types using the deconvolution method developed by Houseman et al. (2012).        Results: The cell type proportion estimates segregated into two groups that were significantly different by gestational age, indicating that gestational age was associated with cell type proportion. Among infants exposed to antenatal steroids, the number of differentially methylated CpGs dropped from 127 to 1 after controlling for cell type proportion.

Genome-wide methylation was profiled using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on blood-derived DNA collected during the eighth examination cycle (2005-2008). Two CpG sites were significantly associated with prevalent AF, and five CpGs were associated with incident AF after correction for multiple testing (FDR < 0.05). Fourteen previously reported genome-wide significant AF-related SNP were each associated with at least one CpG site; the most significant association was rs6490029 at the CUX2 locus and cg10833066 (P = 9.5 x 10(-279)).

Using a Methylome-wide association study in a Brazilian cohort (67 NSCLP, 59 controls), we found 578 methylation variable positions (MVPs) that were significantly associated with NSCLP.

An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with exploratory pathway analysis may help identify potential pyrethroid-related health effects.        Methods: We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants' blood in the Parkinson's Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California (N = 237). We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years (binary) with site-specific differential methylation, and used a false discovery rate (FDR) cut off of 0.05 for significance. We controlled for age, sex, education, cell count, and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity. We normalized methylation values for Type I/II probe bias using Beta-Mixture Quantile (BMIQ) normalization, filtered out cross-reactive probes, and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I/II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p-values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods, and controlling for cell count. To facilitate broader interpretation, we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis, using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw p < 0.05, and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip. We did this for both a biological process context (Gene Ontology terms) using missMethyl, and a disease set context using WebGestalt. For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets.        Results: After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization, 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures. When using GenomeStudio's Illumina normalization, 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated, including all four identified with the BMIQ method. In the gene set overrepresentation analyses, we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization, and 76 using Illumina normalization, including the 6 identified by BMIQ. For disease sets, we identified signals for Alzheimer's disease, leukemia and several other cancers, diabetes, birth defects, and other diseases, for both normalization methods. We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count, and controlling for cell count generally weakened p-values. BMIQ normalization, however, resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p-values.        Conclusions: Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research. However, this EWAS also implicates several novel diseases for future investigation, and highlights the relative importance of different background normalization methods in identifying associations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pesticide exposure",10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113569,DNA METHYLATION;AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES;RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY;URINARY        METABOLITES;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;CALCIUM-CHANNELS;AIR-POLLUTION;RISK;CHILDREN;GENE;Pesticides;California,,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We explored the association between GDM exposure and maternal blood and newborn cord blood methylation in 536 mother-offspring pairs from the prospective FinnGeDi cohort using Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K BeadChip arrays. We assessed two hypotheses. First, we tested for shared maternal and offspring epigenetic effects resulting from GDM exposure. Second, we tested whether GDM exposure and maternal methylation had an epigenetic effect on the offspring. RESULTS We did not find any epigenetic marks (differentially methylated CpG probes) with shared and consistent effects between mothers and offspring. After including maternal methylation in the model, we identified a single significant (false discovery rate 1.38 x 10(-2)) CpG at the cg22790973 probe (TFCP2) associated with GDM.

We conducted a series of epigenome-wide association studies to capture the dynamics of smoking-induced epigenetic changes after smoking cessation, using genome-wide methylation profiles obtained from blood samples in 745 women from 2 European populations. Two distinct classes of CpG sites were identified: sites whose methylation reverts to levels typical of never smokers within decades after smoking cessation, and sites remaining differentially methylated, even more than 35 years after smoking cessation. Our results suggest that the dynamics of methylation changes following smoking cessation are driven by a differential and site-specific magnitude of the smoking-induced alterations (with persistent sites being most affected) irrespective of the intensity and duration of smoking. Analyses of the link between methylation and expression levels revealed that methylation predominantly and remotely down-regulates gene expression. Among genes whose expression was associated with our candidate CpG sites, LRRN3 appeared to be particularly interesting as it was one of the few genes whose methylation and expression were directly associated, and the only gene in which both methylation and gene expression were found associated with smoking.

Recent studies have identified smoking-related DNA methylation (DNAm) sites in Caucasians. To determine whether the same DNAm sites associate with smoking in African Americans, and to identify novel smoking-related DNAm sites, we conducted a methylome-wide association study of cigarette smoking using a discovery sample of 972 African Americans, and a replication sample of 239 African Americans with two array-based methods. Among 15 DNAm sites significantly associated with smoking after correction for multiple testing in our discovery sample, 5 DNAm sites are replicated in an independent cohort, and 14 sites in the replication sample have effects in the same direction as in the discovery sample. The top two smoking-related DNAm sites in F2RL3 (factor II receptor-like 3) and GPR15 (G-protein-coupled receptor 15) observed in African Americans are consistent with previous findings in Caucasians. The associations between the replicated DNAm sites and smoking remain significant after adjusting for genetic background.

With the release of the HumanMethylationEPIC micro-array and datasets containing thousands of samples, analyses of these large datasets using R are becoming impractical due to large memory requirements. As a result there is an increasing need for computationally efficient methodologies to perform meaningful analysis on high dimensional data.        Results Here we introduce the bigmelon R package, which provides a memory efficient workflow that enables users to perform the complex, large scale analyses required in epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) without the need for large RAM. Building on top of the CoreArray Genomic Data Structure file format and libraries packaged in the gdsfmt package, we provide a practical workflow that facilitates the reading-in, preprocessing, quality control and statistical analysis of DNA methylation data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the bigmelon package using a large dataset consisting of 1193 human blood samples from the Understanding Society: UK Household Longitudinal Study, assayed on the EPIC micro-array platform.

Further striking differences between men and women are known, for instance, at the metabolic level. The extent to which men and women vary at the level of the epigenome, however, is not well documented. DNA methylation is the best known epigenetic mechanism to date.        Results: In order to shed light on epigenetic differences, we compared autosomal DNA methylation levels between men and women in blood in a large prospective European cohort of 1799 subjects, and replicated our findings in three independent European cohorts. We identified and validated 1184 CpG sites to be differentially methylated between men and women and observed that these CpG sites were distributed across all autosomes. We showed that some of the differentially methylated loci also exhibit differential gene expression between men and women. Finally, we found that the differentially methylated loci are enriched among imprinted genes, and that their genomic location in the genome is concentrated in CpG island shores.

This non-systematic review focuses on the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring's epigenome, consistent in chemical modifications of the genome that regulate gene expression.        Recent Findings Recent meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies have shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy is consistently associated with offspring's DNA methylation changes, both in the placenta and blood. These studies indicate that effects on blood DNA methylation can persist for years, and that the longer the duration of the exposure and the higher the dose, the larger the effects. Hence, DNA methylation scores have been developed to estimate past exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy as biomarkers.        Summary There is robust evidence for DNA methylation alterations associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy; however, the role of sex, ethnicity, and genetic background needs further exploration. Moreover, there are no conclusive studies about exposure to low doses or during the preconception period. Similarly, studies on tissues other than the placenta and blood are scarce, and cell-type specificity within tissues needs further investigation. In addition, biological interpretation of DNA methylation findings requires multi-omics data, poorly available in epidemiological settings. Finally, although several mediation analyses link DNA methylation changes with health outcomes, they do not allow causal inference. For this, a combination of data from multiple study designs will be essential in the future to better address this topic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1007/s40572-022-00361-9     EA JUN 2022,EXPOSURE;NEWBORNS;BIRTH;PREGNANCY;METAANALYSIS;ASSOCIATION;EPIGENETICS;SIGNATURES;STRESS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Child Welfare;Methylation,,

Epigenetic regulation is considered as a key mediator for this phenomenon but analysis on humans is sparse. The Great Chinese Famine lasting from 1958 to 1961 is a natural string of disasters offering a precious opportunity for elucidating the underlying epigenetic mechanism of the long-term effect of early adversity. Methods: Using a high-throughput array platform for DNA methylome profiling, we conducted a case-control epigenome-wide association study on early-life exposure to Chinese famine in 79 adults born during 1959-1961 and compared to 105 unexposed subjects born 1963-1964. Results: The single CpG site analysis of whole epigenome revealed a predominant pattern of decreased DNA methylation levels associated with fetal exposure to famine. Four CpG sites were detected with p < 1e-06 (linked to EHMT1, CNR1, UBXN7 and ESM1 genes), 16 CpGs detected with 1e-06 < p < 1e-05 and 157 CpGs with 1e-05 < p < 1e-04, with a predominant pattern of hypomethylation. Functional annotation to genes and their enriched biological pathways mainly involved neurodevelopment, neuropsychological disorders and metabolism. Multiple sites analysis detected two top-rank differentially methylated regions harboring RNF39 on chromosome 6 and PTPRN2 on chromosome 7, both showing epigenetic association with stress-related conditions. Conclusion: Early-life exposure to famine could mediate DNA methylation regulations that persist into adulthood with broad impacts in the activities of genes and biological pathways.

Associations of cytosine-guanine di-nucleotide (CpG) methylation with clinical endpoints that overlap with metabolic phenotypes suggest a regulatory role for these CpG sites in the body's response to disease or environmental stress. We previously identified 20 CpG sites in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with metabolomics that were also associated in recent EWASs with diabetes-, obesity-, and smoking-related endpoints. To elucidate the molecular pathways that connect these potentially regulatory CpG sites to the associated disease or lifestyle factors, we conducted a multi-omics association study including 2474 mass-spectrometry-based metabolites in plasma, urine and saliva, 225 NMR-based lipid and metabolite measures in blood, 1124 blood-circulating proteins using aptamer technology, 113 plasma protein N-glycans and 60 IgG-glyans, using 359 samples from the multi-ethnic Qatar Metabolomics Study on Diabetes (QMDiab). We report 138 multi-omics associations at these CpG sites, including diabetes biomarkers at the diabetes-associated TXNIP locus, and smoking-specific metabolites and proteins at multiple smoking-associated loci, including AHRR. Mendelian randomization suggests a causal effect of metabolite levels on methylation of obesity-associated CpG sites, i.e. of glycerophospholipid PC(O-36: 5), glycine and a very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-A) on the methylation of the obesity-associated CpG loci DHCR24, MYO5C and CPT1A, respectively.

We aimed to identify DNA methylation changes during a 6-year period associated with early hyperglycaemia exposure using the longitudinal D.E.S.I.R. cohort.        Methods: - We selected individuals with progressive hyperglycaemia exposure based on T2DM diagnostic criteria: 27 with long-term exposure, 34 with short-term exposure and 34 normoglycaemic controls. DNA from blood at inclusion and at the 6-year visit was subjected to methylation analysis using 850K methylation-EPIC arrays. A linear mixed model was used to perform an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identify methylated changes associated with hyperglycaemia exposure during a 6-year time-period.        Results: - We did not identify differentially methylated sites that reached false discovery rate (FDR)-significance in our cohort. Based on EWAS, we focused our analysis on methylation sites that had a constant effect during the 6 years across the hyperglycaemia groups compared to controls and found the most statistically significant site was the reported cg19693031 probe (TXNIP). We also performed an EWAS with HbAlc, using the inclusion and the 6-year methylation data and did not identify any FDR-significant CpGs.        Conclusions: - Our study reveals that DNA methylation changes are not robustly associated with hyperglycaemia exposure or HbAlc during a short-term period, however, our top loci indicate potential interest and should be replicated in larger cohorts.

Pregnant women aged not more than 35 years old, not currently smoking or exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, who did not report obesity before conception were considered eligible. They were further tested for atopy. Converted DNA from cord blood was analysed using Infinium MethylationEPIC; for statistical analysis, RnBeads software was applied. Gestational age and sex were included as covariates in the final analysis. 83 DM sites were associated with maternal atopy. Within the top DM sites, there were CpG sites which mapped to genes SCD, ITM2C, NT5C3A and NPEPL1. Regional analysis revealed 25 tiling regions, 4 genes, 3 CpG islands and 5 gene promoters, (including PIGCP1, ADAM3A, ZSCAN12P1) associated with maternal atopy. Gene content analysis revealed pointwise enrichments in pathways related to purine-containing compound metabolism, the G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle, stem cell division and cellular glucose homoeostasis.

The causal pathology of AD (accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau), precedes hallmark symptoms of dementia by more than a decade, necessitating development of early diagnostic markers of disease onset, particularly for new drugs that aim to modify disease processes. To evaluate differentially methylated positions (DMPs) as novel blood-based biomarkers of AD, we used a subset of 653 individuals with peripheral blood (PB) samples in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortium. The selected cohort of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-matched healthy controls (CN) all had imaging, genetics, transcriptomics, cerebrospinal protein markers, and comprehensive clinical records, providing a rich resource of concurrent multi-omics and phenotypic information on a well-phenotyped subset of ADNI participants. Results In this manuscript, we report cross-diagnosis differential peripheral DNA methylation in a cohort of AD, MCI, and age-matched CN individuals with longitudinal DNA methylation measurements. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed using a mixed model with repeated measures over time with aPvalue cutoff of 1 x 10(-5)to test contrasts of pairwise differential peripheral methylation in AD vs CN, AD vs MCI, and MCI vs CN. The most highly significant differentially methylated loci also tracked with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Differentially methylated loci were enriched near brain and neurodegeneration-related genes (e.g.,BDNF, BIN1, APOC1) validated using the genotype tissue expression project portal (GTex). Conclusions Our work shows that peripheral differential methylation between age-matched subjects with AD relative to healthy controls will provide opportunities to further investigate and validate differential methylation as a surrogate of disease. Given the inaccessibility of brain tissue, the PB-associated methylation marks may help identify the stage of disease and progression phenotype, information that would be central to bringing forward successful drugs for AD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-020-00864-y,EXPRESSION;PROGRESS;EPIGENETICS;PHENOTYPES;DECLINE;GENES;ARRAY;ANK1;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Alzheimer Disease;Methylation,,

Although the mechanisms linking adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation(3-6), a key regulator of gene expression and molecular phenotype(7). Here we use epigenome-wide association to show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P < 1 x 10(-7), range P = 9.2 x 10(-8) to 6.0 x 10(-46); n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P < 0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P < 9.0 x 10(-6), range P = 5.5 x 10(-6) to 6.1 x 10(-35), n = 1,785 samples). The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3 (2.07-2.56); P = 1.1 x 10(-54)). Our results provide new insights into the biologic pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies for prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes and other adverse clinical consequences of obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat",10.1038/nature20784,DNA METHYLATION;MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION;OBESITY;DISEASE;GLUCOSE;HEALTH;TRENDS;TISSUE;BLOOD;Body Mass Index;Epigenomics,,

Epidemiological studies have established that grandparental exposures are associated with health outcomes in their grandchildren, often with sex-specific effects; however, the mechanism of transmission is still unclear. We conducted Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) to test whether grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with altered DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood from their adolescent grandchildren. We used data from a birth cohort, with discovery and replication datasets of up to 1225 and 708 individuals (respectively, for the maternal line), aged 15-17 years, and tested replication in the same individuals at birth and 7 years. We show for the first time that DNAm at a small number of loci in cord blood is associated with grandmaternal smoking in humans. In adolescents we see suggestive associations in regions of the genome which we hypothesised a priori could be involved in transgenerational transmission - we observe sex-specific associations at two sites on the X chromosome and one in an imprinting control region. All are within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and we observe enrichment for TFBS among the CpG sites with the strongest associations; however, there is limited evidence that the associations we see replicate between timepoints. The implication of this work is that effects of smoking during pregnancy may induce DNAm changes in later generations and that these changes are often sex-specific, in line with epidemiological associations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1038/s41431-022-01081-2     EA MAR 2022,"MATERNAL SMOKING;EPIGENOME;NEWBORNS;CHILDREN;Pregnancy;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",,

However, longitudinal observations are lacking. Objective: To identify 5 '-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3 ' in DNA (CpG) sites associated with body mass index (BMI) and examine the temporal relationship between dynamic changes in DNAm and BMI in a longitudinal cohort. Methods and Results: Race-specific EWASs were performed in 995 whites and 490 blacks from the Bogalusa Heart Study. Suggestive CpG sites were further replicated in 252 whites and 228 blacks from the Georgia Stress and Heart Study. Cross-lagged panel analysis was used to examine the temporal relationship between DNAm and BMI in 439 whites and 201 blacks who were examined twice 6.2 years apart. In discovery and replication samples, 349 CpG sites (266 novel) in whites and 36 (21 novel) in blacks were identified to be robustly associated with BMI, with 8 (1 novel) CpG sites overlapping between the 2 races. Cross-lagged panel analyses showed significant unidirectional paths (P-FDR <0.05) from baseline BMI to follow-up DNAm at 18 CpG sites in whites and 7 in blacks; no CpG sites showed significant paths from DNAm at baseline to BMI at follow-up. Baseline BMI was associated with a DNAm score (calculated from DNAm levels at the associated CpG sites) at follow-up (P<0.001 both in blacks and in whites).

Current biomarkers to detect smoking have significant limitations, notably a short half-life for detection and lack of sensitivity for light smokers. These limitations may be particularly problematic in populations with less accurate self-reporting. Prior epigenome-wide association studies indicate that methylation status at cg05575921, a CpG residue located in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene, may be a robust indicator of smoking status in individuals with as little as half of a pack-year of smoking. In this study, we show that a novel droplet digital PCR assay for measuring methylation at cg05575921 can reliably detect smoking status, as confirmed by serum cotinine, in populations with different demographic characteristics, smoking histories, and rates of false-negative self-report of smoking behavior. Using logistic regression models, we show that obtaining maximum accuracy in predicting smoking status depends on appropriately weighting self-report and cg05575921 methylation according to the characteristics of the sample being tested. Furthermore, models using only cg05575921 methylation to predict smoking perform nearly as well as those also including self-report across populations. In conclusion, cg05575921 has significant potential as a clinical biomarker to detect smoking in populations with varying rates of accuracy in self-report of smoking behavior.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No EWAS",10.1002/ajmg.b.32555,SERUM COTININE LEVELS;DNA METHYLATION;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;BLOOD-SAMPLES;CESSATION;TIME;PERFORMANCE;VALIDATION;COMMUNITY;EXPOSURE;Biological Markers;Smoke,,

In the meta-analysis of all the participants, we discovered 21 mtDNA CN-associated DNA methylation sites (CpG) (P < 1 x 10(-7)), with a 0.7-3.0 standard deviation increase (3 CpGs) or decrease (18 CpGs) in mtDNA CN corresponding to a 1% increase in DNA methylation. Several significant CpGs have been reported to be associated with at least two risk factors (e.g. chronological age or smoking) for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Five genes [PR/SET domain 16, nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 (NR1H3), DNA repair protein, DNA polymerase kappa and decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 2], which harbor nine significant CpGs, are known to be involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis and functions. For example, NR1H3 encodes a transcription factor that is differentially expressed during an adipose tissue transition. The methylation level of cg09548275 in NR1H3 was negatively associated with mtDNA CN (effect size = -1.71, P = 4 x 10(-8)) and was positively associated with the NR1H3 expression level (effect size = 0.43, P = 0.0003), which indicates that the methylation level in NR1H3 may underlie the relationship between mtDNA CN, the NR1H3 transcription factor and energy expenditure. In summary, the study results suggest that mtDNA CN variation in whole blood is associated with DNA methylation levels in genes that are involved in a wide range of mitochondrial activities. These findings will help reveal molecular mechanisms between mtDNA CN and CVD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/hmg/ddab240     EA AUG 2021,DNA METHYLATION;GENE-EXPRESSION;ATHEROSCLEROSIS RISK;PERIPHERAL-BLOOD;SKELETAL-MUSCLE;DESIGN;HEALTH;TRANSCRIPTION;INTERFACE;DISCOVERY;Genome;Genomics;Epigenomics,,

Here, we conducted single-site and differentially methylated region (DMR) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of these factors, in addition to similar to 3-year survival, using Illumina Methylation EPIC DNA methylation profiles from whole blood in 409 individuals as part of the Head and Neck 5000 (HN5000) study. Overlapping sites between each factor and survival were then assessed using two-step Mendelian randomization to assess whether methylation at these positions causally affected survival. Results Using the MethylationEPIC array in an OPC dataset, we found novel CpG associations with smoking, alcohol consumption and similar to 3-year survival. We found no CpG associations below our multiple testing threshold associated with HPV16 E6 serological response (used as a proxy for HPV infection). CpG site associations below our multiple-testing threshold (P-Bonferroni< 0.05) for both a prognostic factor and survival were observed at four gene regions:SPEG(smoking),GFI1(smoking),PPT2(smoking) andKHDC3L(alcohol consumption). Evidence for a causal effect of DNA methylation on survival was only observed in theSPEGgene region (HR per SD increase in methylation score 1.28, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.43,P2.12 x 10(-05)). Conclusions Part of the effect of smoking on survival in those with oropharyngeal cancer may be mediated by methylation at theSPEGgene locus.

Epigenome-Wide Association Analysis (EWAS) of DNA methylation may identify markers that contribute to an individual's risk of adverse transplant outcomes, yet only a limited number of EWAS have been conducted in kidney transplant recipients. This EWAS aimed to interrogate the methylation profile of a kidney transplant recipient cohort with minimal posttransplant complications, exploring differences in samples pretransplant and posttransplant.Methods: We compared differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (dmCpGs) in samples derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the same kidney transplant recipients, collected both pretransplant and posttransplant (N = 154), using the Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

Research investigating epigenetic mechanisms related to obesity and obesity-associated conditions has identified differences that may contribute to cellular dysregulation that accelerates the development of disease. However, few studies include Black women, who experience the highest incidence of obesity and early onset of cardiometabolic disorders. MethodsThe association of BMI with epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was examined using the 850K Illumina EPIC BeadChip in two Black populations (Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure [InterGEN], n = 239; and The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy [GENOA] study, n = 961) using linear mixed-effects regression models adjusted for batch effects, cell type heterogeneity, population stratification, and confounding factors. ResultsCross-sectional analysis of the InterGEN discovery cohort identified 28 DNAm sites significantly associated with BMI, 24 of which had not been previously reported. Of these, 17 were replicated using the GENOA study. In addition, a meta-analysis, including both the InterGEN and GENOA cohorts, identified 658 DNAm sites associated with BMI with false discovery rate < 0.05. In a meta-analysis of Black women, we identified 628 DNAm sites significantly associated with BMI. Using a more stringent significance threshold of Bonferroni-corrected p value 0.05, 65 and 61 DNAm sites associated with BMI were identified from the combined sex and female-only meta-analyses, respectively.

The processes responsible for reduced lung function in PLWH are largely unknown. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to investigate whether blood DNA methylation is associated with impaired lung function in PLWH.        Methods        Using blood DNA methylation profiles from 161 PLWH, we tested the effect of methylation on FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 decline over a median of 5 years. We evaluated the global methylation of PLWH with airflow obstruction by testing the differential methylation of transposable elements Alu and LINE-1, a well-described marker of epigenetic ageing.        Results        Airflow obstruction as defined by a FEV1/FVC<0.70 was associated with 1393 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), while 4676 were associated with airflow obstruction based on the FEV1/FVC<lower limit of normal. These DMPs were enriched for biological pathways associated with chronic viral infections. The airflow obstruction group was globally hypomethylated compared with those without airflow obstruction. 103 and 7112 DMPs were associated with FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, respectively. No positions were associated with FEV1 decline.        Conclusion        A large number of DMPs were associated with airflow obstruction and lung function in a unique cohort of PLWH. Airflow obstruction in even relatively young PLWH is associated with global hypomethylation, suggesting advanced epigenetic ageing compared with those with normal lung function. The disturbance of the epigenetic regulation of key genes not previously identified in non-HIV COPD cohorts could explain the unique risk of COPD in PLWH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-215866,HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS;LUNG-FUNCTION;PULMONARY-DISEASE;ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY;BLOOD;RISK;HYPOMETHYLATION;MORTALITY;INFECTION;GENE;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

Results: We identified a differential DNA methylation signature of fetal exposure to maternal T. cruzi infection, in the absence of parasite transmission, with 12 differentially methylated sites in B cells and CD4(+) T cells, including eight protein-coding genes.

We analyzed DNA methylation of acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7), mucin 4 (MUC4), schlafen 12 (SLFN12), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2), and interleukin-4 (IL4) in PBMCs and NMSCs using bisulfite next-generation sequencing; the correlation of DNA methylation with non-specific IgE and cedar pollen-specific IgE levels in peripheral blood samples was also investigated. Symptom severity and DNA methylation were investigated in 15 untreated CP patients.        Results        Non-specific IgE levels showed a significant negative correlation with average IL4 methylation in PBMCs (r = -0.46, P < 0.0001) but not with methylation of ACOT7, MUC4, SLFN12, and LPCAT2. Cedar pollen-specific IgE levels showed a significant negative correlation with average IL4 and MUC4 methylation in PBMCs (r = -0.31, P = 0.01 and r = -0.241, P = 0.046, respectively) but not with methylation of ACOT7, SLFN12, and LPCAT2. The methylation of some genes in NMSCs was not significantly correlated with IgE levels. The mean methylation of LPCAT2 in NMSCs showed a decreasing trend with increasing severity of CP (P = 0.027).        Conclusion        LPCAT2 methylation in NMSCs may reflect the severity of CP and could be used as a novel biomarker to identify suitable treatment options for CP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1177/1945892420983646     EA DEC 2020,Biological Markers;Methylation;Japan;Pollen,,

We pooled summary statistics from six trans -ethnic epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of BMI representing nine cohorts (n = 17,034), replicated these findings in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI, n = 4,822), and developed an epigenetic prediction score of BMI. In the pooled EWASs, 1,265 CpG sites were associated with BMI (p < 1E-7) and 1,238 replicated in the WHI (FDR < 0.05). We performed several stratified analyses to examine whether these associations differed between individuals of European and African descent, as defined by self-reported race/ ethnicity. We found that five CpG sites had a significant interaction with BMI by race/ethnicity. To examine the utility of the significant CpG sites in predicting BMI, we used elastic net regression to predict log-normalized BMI in the WHI (80% training/20% testing). This model found that 397 sites could explain 32% of the variance in BMI in the WHI test set. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI overestimated their BMI (high epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher glucose and triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to accurately predicted BMI. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI underestimated their BMI (low epige-netic BMI) had significantly higher HDL cholesterol and lower glucose and triglycerides. This study confirmed 553 and identified 685 CpG sites associated with BMI. Participants with high epigenetic BMI had poorer metabolic health, suggesting that the overestimation may be driven in part by cardiometabolic derangements characteristic of metabolic syndrome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,body fat,Meta-analysis",10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.12.014,BODY-MASS INDEX;DNA METHYLATION;OBESITY;ASSOCIATION;HEALTH;INFLAMMATION;BLOOD;Epigenomics,,

Cord blood has unique cell types and the epigenetic signatures of standard cell types may not be consistent throughout the life course. Using magnetic bead sorting, we isolated cord blood cell types (nucleated red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, CD4(+)T cells, and CD8(+)T cells) from 17 live births at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We confirmed enrichment of the cell types using fluorescence assisted cell sorting and ran DNA from the separated cell types on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. After filtering, the final analysis was on 104 samples at 429,794 probes. We compared cell type specific signatures in cord to each other and methylation at 49.2% of CpG sites on the array differed by cell type (F-test P < 10(-8)). Differences between nucleated red blood cells and the remainder of the cell types were most pronounced (36.9% of CpG sites at P < 10(-8)) and 99.5% of these sites were hypomethylated relative to the other cell types.

Panic disorder (PD) has been linked with changes in leukocytes distributions in several small studies using different methods for immune characterization. Additionally, alterations in the methylation of repetitive DNA elements, such as LINE-1, have been associated with mental disorders. Here, we use peripheral blood DNA methylation data from two studies and an updated DNA methylation deconvolution library to investigate the relation of leukocyte proportions and methylation status of repetitive elements in 133 patients with panic disorder compared with 118 controls. Methods and results We used DNA methylation data to deconvolute leukocyte cell-type proportions and to infer LINE-1 element methylation comparing PD cases and controls. We also identified differentially methylated CpGs associated with PD using an epigenome-wide association study approach (EWAS), with models adjusting for sex, age, and cell-type proportions. Individuals with PD had a lower proportion of CD8T cells (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.96, P-adj = 0.030) when adjusting for age, sex, and study compared with controls. Also, PD cases had significantly lower LINE-1 repetitive element methylation than controls (P < 0.001). The EWAS identified 61 differentially methylated CpGs (58 hypo- and 3 hypermethylated) in PD (Bonferroni adjusted P < 1.33 x 10(-7)).

Recent technical advances in the genome-wide determination of single-base DNA-methylation enabled epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Early EWASs established robust associations between age and gender with the degree of CpG methylation at specific sites. Other studies uncovered associations with cigarette smoking. However, so far these studies were mainly conducted in Caucasians, raising the question of whether these findings can also be extrapolated to other populations.        Results: Here, we present an EWAS with age, gender, and smoking status in a family study of 123 individuals of Arab descent. We determined DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, applied state-of-the-art data processing protocols, including correction for blood cell type heterogeneity and hidden confounders, and eliminated probes containing SNPs at the targeted CpG site using 40x whole-genome sequencing data. Using this approach, we could replicate the leading published EWAS associations with age, gender and smoking, and recovered hallmarks of gender-specific epigenetic changes. Interestingly, we could even replicate the recently reported precise prediction of chronological age based on the methylation of only a few selected CpG sites.        Conclusion: Our study supports the view that when applied with state-of-the art protocols to account for all potential confounders, DNA methylation arrays represent powerful tools for EWAS with more complex phenotypes that can also be successfully applied to non-Caucasian populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1186/s13148-014-0040-6,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;BLOOD;GENE;EPIGENETICS;DESIGN;DIET;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Arabs;Methylation,,

However, none of these studies have included Mexican Americans.        Methods: In the current study, we assessed levels of HIF3A methylation in 927 Mexican American women identified from Mano-A-Mano, the Mexican American Cohort study.        Results: Significantly higher methylation levels at three CpG sites (position 46801557, 46801642, and 46801699) were observed in obese women compared to non-obese women (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that elevated methylation levels at those three CpG sites were associated with significant weight gain (P < 0.05), defined as an increase in BMI by at least one category between the baseline and the followup, with a median follow-up time of 39 months. Then, using pre-diagnostic blood DNA samples, we found increased DNA methylation at CpG 46801642 to be associated with a 1.35-fold increased risk of breast cancer (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.35, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.02, 3.01), with a median follow-up time of 127 months. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we further found that levels of HIF3A were significantly higher-methylated and down-regulated in breast tumor than in normal tissues (P < 1 x 10(12) for both).

Much of this is attributed to the late diagnosis. To identify biomarkers for early detection, we examined DNA methylation differences in leukocyte DNA between PaC cases and controls in a two-phase study. In phase I, we measured methylation levels at 1,505 CpG sites in treatment-naive leukocyte DNA from 132 never-smoker PaC patients and 60 never-smoker healthy controls. We found significant differences in 110 CpG sites (false discovery rate < 0.05). In phase II, we tested and validated 88 of 96 phase I selected CpG sites in 240 PaC cases and 240 matched controls (p <= 0.05). Using penalized logistic regression, we built a prediction model consisting of five CpG sites (IL10_P348, LCN2_P86, ZAP70_P220, AIM2_P624, TAL1_P817) that discriminated PaC patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.85 in phase I; 0.76 in phase II). Interestingly, one CpG site (LCN2_P86) alone could discriminate resectable patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.78 in phase I; 0.74 in phase II). We also performed methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis and identified three CpG sites (AGXT_P180_F, ALOX12_E85_R, JAK3_P1075_R) where the methylation levels were significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate,0.05). Our results demonstrate that epigenetic variation in easily obtainable leukocyte DNA, manifested by reproducible methylation differences, may be used to detect PaC patients.

We conducted analyses among 206 cases and 251 controls that were current or never smokers at baseline from a previous case-control study of bladder cancer and genome-wide DNA methylation nested within the Women's Health Initiative. Separate mediation analyses were conducted for three CpG sites demonstrating robust associations with smoking in prior methylome-wide association studies: cg05575921 (AhRR), cg03636183 (F2RL3), and cg19859270 (GPR15). We estimated causal effects using the regression-based, four-way decomposition approach, which addresses the interaction between smoking and each CpG site. The overall proportion of the excess relative risk mediated by cg05575921 was 92% (p-value = 0.004) and by cg19859270 was 79% (p-value = 0.02).

DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at specific CpG positions are hallmarks of aging evidenced by the presence of age-associated differentially methylated CpG positions (aDMPs) that are the basis for the epigenetic clock for measuring biological age acceleration. Since DNAm has not been widely studied among non-European populations, we examined the association between DNAm and chronological age in AAs and whites, and the association between race, poverty, sex, and epigenetic age acceleration. Results We measured genome-wide DNA methylation (866,836 CpGs) using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip in blood DNA extracted from 487 middle-aged AA (N = 244) and white (N = 243), men (N = 248), and women (N = 239). The mean (sd) age was 48.4 (8.8) in AA and 49.0 (8.7) in whites (p = 0.48). We identified 4930 significantly associated aDMPs in AAs and 469 in whites. Of these, 75.6% and 53.1% were novel, largely driven by the increased number of measured CpGs in the EPIC array, in AA and whites, respectively. AAs had more age-associated DNAm changes than whites in genes implicated in age-related diseases and cellular pathways involved in growth and development. We assessed three epigenetic age acceleration measures (universal, intrinsic, and extrinsic). AAs had a significantly slower extrinsic aging compared to whites. Furthermore, compared to AA women, both AA and white men had faster aging in the universal age acceleration measure (+ 2.04 and + 1.24 years, respectively, p < 0.05).

Race and sex interact to underlie biological age acceleration suggesting altered DNA methylation patterns may be important in age-associated health disparities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-019-0722-1,SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;CHRONOLOGICAL AGE;BIOLOGICAL AGE;CPG SITES;WIDE;HEALTH;MICROARRAY;CLOCK;BLOOD;RACE;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Middle Aged;Methylation;European Continental Ancestry Group,,

Some of these changes have been suggested to mediate part of the effect of smoking on lung cancer. However, limitations with conventional mediation analyses mean that the causal nature of these methylation changes has yet to be fully elucidated.        Methods: We first performed a meta-analysis of four epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of lung cancer (918 cases, 918 controls). Next, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, using genetic instruments for methylation at CpG sites identified in the EWAS meta-analysis, and 29 863 cases and 55 586 controls from the TRICL-ILCCO lung cancer consortium, to appraise the possible causal role of methylation at these sites on lung cancer.        Results: Sixteen CpG sites were identified from the EWAS meta-analysis [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05], for 14 of which we could identify genetic instruments. Mendelian randomization provided little evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood at the 14 CpG sites plays a causal role in lung cancer development (FDR > 0.05), including for cg05575921-AHRR where methylation is strongly associated with both smoke exposure and lung cancer risk.        Conclusions: The results contrast with previous observational and mediation analysis, which have made strong claims regarding the causal role of DNA methylation. Thus, previous suggestions of a mediating role of methylation at sites identified in peripheral blood, such as cg05575921-AHRR, could be unfounded. However, this study does not preclude the possibility that differential DNA methylation at other sites is causally involved in lung cancer development, especially within lung tissue.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1093/ije/dyz190,MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION;SMOKING;ASSOCIATION;BIAS;INSTRUMENTS;EFFICIENT;DESIGN;LOCI;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Lung Neoplasms;Lung;DNA,,

Differential DNA methylation may explain this association.        OBJECTIVES: Our main aim was to study the association between long-term air pollution exposure and DNA methylation.        METHODS: We performed a genome-wide methylation study using robust linear regression models in 1,017 subjects from the LifeLines cohort study to analyze the association between exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5, fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m; PM10, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) and PM2.5absorbance, indicator of elemental carbon content (estimated with land use-regression models) with DNA methylation in whole blood (Illumina (R) HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). Replication of the top hits was attempted in two independent samples from the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg studies (KORA).        RESULTS: Depending on the p-value threshold used, we found significant associations between NO2 exposure and DNA methylation for seven CpG sites (Bonferroni corrected threshold p < 1.19 x 10(-7)) or for 4,980 CpG sites (False Discovery Rate<0.05). The top associated CpG site was annotated to the PSMB9 gene (i.e., cg04908668). None of the seven Bonferroni significant CpG-sites were significantly replicated in the two KORA-cohorts. No associations were found for PM exposure.        CONCLUSIONS: Long-term NO2 exposure was genome-wide significantly associated with DNA methylation in the identification cohort but not in the replication cohort. Future studies arc needed to further elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying NO2-exposure related respiratory disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: air pollution",10.1289/EHP2045,OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE;FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;USE        REGRESSION-MODELS;EPIGENETIC MEDIATION;NITROGEN-DIOXIDE;PHOSPHOLIPASE-D;ASSOCIATIONS;ESCAPE;ACTIVATION;DENSITY;Cohort Studies;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Lung;Genome;Genomics;DNA,,

However, there is no strong evidence that epigenetic alterations are directly causal for disease pathogenesis. In this study, we combined SNP and DNA methylation data with measurements of protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation or cardiovascular disease, to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation on biomarker levels. A total of 121 protein biomarkers were measured and analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and to over 10 million SNPs. We performed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses, and integrated biomarker, DNA methylation and SNP data using between 698 and 1033 samples depending on data availability for the different analyses. We identified 124 and 45 loci (Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.05) with effect sizes up to 0.22 standard units' change per 1% change in DNA methylation levels and up to four standard units' change per copy of the effective allele in the EWAS and GWAS respectively. Most GWAS loci were cisregulatory whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one in NLRC5 associated with CXCL11, CXCL9, IL12, and IL-18 levels. All EWAS signals that overlapped with a GWAS locus were driven by underlying genetic variants and three EWAS signals were confounded by smoking. While some cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect also on DNA methylation levels, cis-regulatory SNPs for DNA methylation were not observed to affect biomarker levels. We present associations between protein biomarker and DNA methylation levels at numerous loci in the genome. The associations are likely to reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects to the pathogenesis of disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1371/journal.pgen.1007005,GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION;CANCER;EXPRESSION;INSTRUMENTS;EPIGENETICS;ETIOLOGY;THERAPY;BLOOD;MASS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Methylation,,

Results: We identified one wheezing-associated differentially methylated region (DMR) spanning ten sequential CpG sites in the promoter-regulatory region of PM20D1 gene (family-wise error rate < 0.05).

There has been an interest in developing epigenetic biomarkers for HAD that might complement clinical assessment. Because alcohol consumption has been previously linked to DNA methylation (DNAm), we aimed to select DNAm signatures in blood to predict HAD from two demographically and clinically distinct populations (N-total = 1,549). We first separately conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for phosphatidylethanol (PEth), an objective measure of alcohol consumption, and for self-reported alcohol consumption in Cohort 1. We identified 83 PEth-associated CpGs, including 23 CpGs previously associated with alcohol consumption or alcohol use disorder. In contrast, no CpG reached epigenome-wide significance on self-reported alcohol consumption. Using a machine learning approach, two CpG subsets from EWAS on PEth and on self-reported alcohol consumption from Cohort 1 were separately tested for the prediction of HAD in Cohort 2. We found that a subset of 143 CpGs selected from the EWAS on PEth showed an excellent prediction of HAD with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 89.4% in training set and 73.9% in validation set of Cohort 2. However, CpGs preselected from the EWAS on self-reported alcohol consumption showed a poor prediction of HAD with AUC 75.2% in training set and 57.6% in validation set. Our results demonstrate that an objective measure for alcohol consumption is a more informative phenotype than self-reported data for revealing epigenetic mechanisms.

Human studies have concentrated on the effects of nutrition during early gestation. Lacking in humans is an epigenome-wide association study of DNA methylation in relation to perturbations in nutrition across all gestation periods.        Methods: We used the quasi-experimental setting of the Dutch famine of 1944-45 to evaluate the impact of famine exposure during specific 10-week gestation periods, or during any time in gestation, on genome-wide DNA methylation levels at age similar to 59 years. In addition, we evaluated the impact of exposure during a shorter pre- and post-conception period. DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina 450k array in whole blood among 422 individuals with prenatal famine exposure and 463 time-or sibling-controls without prenatal famine exposure.        Results: Famine exposure during gestation weeks 1-10, but not weeks 11-20, 21-30 or 31-delivery, was associated with an increase in DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides cg20823026 (FAM150B), cg10354880 (SLC38A2) and cg27370573 (PPAP2C) and a decrease of cg11496778 (OSBPL5/MRGPRG) (P<5.9 x 10(-7), P-FDR<0.031). There was an increase in methylation of TACC1 and ZNF385A after exposure during any time in gestation (P<2.0 x 10(-7), P-FDR = 0.034) and a decrease of cg23989336 (TMEM105) after exposure around conception.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may mediate the impact of heritable genetic variation on phenotypes. Here, we investigated whether DNA methylation mediates the effect of genetic risk loci for childhood ALL. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) including 808 childhood ALL cases and 919 controls from California-based studies using neonatal blood DNA. For differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs), we next conducted association analysis with 23 known ALL risk SNPs followed by causal mediation analyses addressing the significant SNP-DMP pairs. DNA methylation at CpG cg01139861, in the promoter region of IKZF1, mediated the effects of the intronic IKZF1 risk SNP rs78396808, with the average causal mediation effect (ACME) explaining similar to 30% of the total effect (ACME P = 0.0031). In analyses stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity, the mediation effect was only significant in Latinos, explaining similar to 41% of the total effect of rs78396808 on ALL risk (ACME P = 0.0037). Conditional analyses confirmed the presence of at least three independent genetic risk loci for childhood ALL at IKZF1, with rs78396808 unique to non-European populations. We also demonstrated that the most significant DMP in the EWAS, CpG cg13344587 at gene ARID5B (P = 8.61 x 10(-10)), was entirely confounded by the ARID5B ALL risk SNP rs7090445.

The majority of genes with differential methylation at a suggestive threshold did not overlap between the two disorders. Pathways significant in PTSD included a regulator of synaptic plasticity, oxytocin signaling, cholinergic synapse and inflammatory disease pathways, while only phosphatidylinositol signaling and cell cycle pathways emerged in MDD. The failure of the current EWA analyses to detect significant epigenome-wide associations is in contrast with disparate findings from previous, smaller EWA and candidate gene studies of PTSD and MDD.

Since DNA methylation is affected by genetic variation at certain loci, EWAS associations may be potentially influenced by genetic effects. However, a formal assessment of the value of incorporating genetic variation in EWAS evaluations is lacking especially for multiethnic populations. Methods: Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from Illumina Omni Express or Affymetrix PMDA arrays and DNA methylation data from the Illumina 450 K or EPIC array from 1638 newborns of diverse genetic ancestries, we generated DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) databases for both array types. We then investigated associations between neonatal DNA methylation and birthweight (incorporating gestational age) using EWAS modeling, and reported how EWAS results were influenced by controlling for mQTLs. Results: For CpGs on the 450 K array, an average of 15.4% CpGs were assigned as mQTLs, while on the EPIC array, 23.0% CpGs were matched to mQTLs (adjusted P value < 0.05). The CpGs associated with SNPs were enriched in the CpG island shore regions. Correcting for mQTLs in the EWAS model for birthweight helped to increase significance levels for top hits. For CpGs overlapping genes associated with birthweight-related pathways (nutrition metabolism, biosynthesis, for example), accounting for mQTLs changed their regression coefficients more dramatically (> 20%) than for other random CpGs. Conclusion: DNA methylation levels at circa 20% CpGs in the genome were affected by common SNP genotypes. EWAS model fit significantly improved when taking these genetic effects into consideration. Genetic effects were stronger on CpGs overlapping genetic elements associated with control of gene expression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-022-01385-6,"MATERNAL SMOKING;CANCER;MUTATIONS;DISCOVERY;BIAS;SET;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Infant, Newborn;Methylation",,

Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to examine association of plasma zinc with DNA methylation in peripheral blood.

However, identifying effects on the variability (scale) of an outcome, and combining tests of mean and variability (location-and-scale), could provide additional insights into biological mechanisms. A joint test could improve power for studies of high-dimensional phenotypes, such as epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation at CpG sites. One possible cause of heterogeneity of variance is a variable interacting with exposure in its effect on outcome, so a joint test of mean and variability could help in the identification of effect modifiers. Here, we review a scale test, based on the Brown-Forsythe test, for analysing variability of a continuous outcome with respect to both categorical and continuous exposures, and develop a novel joint location-and-scale score (JLSsc) test. These tests were compared to alternatives in simulations and used to test associations of mean and variability of DNA methylation with gender and gestational age using data from the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomics Studies (ARIES). In simulations, the Brown-Forsythe and JLSsc tests retained correct type I error rates when the outcome was not normally distributed in contrast to the other approaches tested which all had inflated type I error rates. These tests also identified > 7500 CpG sites for which either mean or variability in cord blood methylation differed according to gender or gestational age.

We have therefore performed a series of epigenome-wide association studies in 5019 blood samples collected at multiple time-points from birth to late adolescence from 2348 participants of two large independent cohorts. DNAm profiles of autosomal CpG sites (CpGs) were generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Change over time was widespread, observed at over one-half (53%) of CpGs. In most cases, DNAm was decreasing (36% of CpGs). Inter-individual variation in linear trajectories was similarly widespread (27% of CpGs). Evidence for non-linear change and inter-individual variation in non-linear trajectories was somewhat less common (11 and 8% of CpGs, respectively). Very little inter-individual variation in change was explained by sex differences (0.4% of CpGs) even though sex-specific DNAm was observed at 5% of CpGs. DNAm trajectories were distributed non-randomly across the genome. For example, CpGs with decreasing DNAm were enriched in gene bodies and enhancers and were annotated to genes enriched in immune-developmental functions. In contrast, CpGs with increasing DNAm were enriched in promoter regions and annotated to genes enriched in neurodevelopmental functions. These findings depict a methylome undergoing widespread and often non-linear change throughout childhood. They support a developmental role for DNA methylation that extends beyond birth into late adolescence and has implications for understanding life-long health and disease.

This means that abnormal changes to the epigenome may lead to disease and that finding and treating these abnormalities may in turn help treat disease. In this study of liver tissue from individuals with two rare liver diseases, primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis, the authors found that the epigenome of these two conditions is distinct, suggesting that the epigenome is linked to the development of these conditions and may be the key to treating them.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.2217/epi-2021-0343,PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS;SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS;PRIMARY        BILIARY CHOLANGITIS;CD4+ T-CELLS;CHRONIC HEPATITIS;PERIPHERAL-BLOOD;GENE;PROMOTER;DEMETHYLATION;EPIGENETICS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Liver Diseases;Liver;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between gestational PFAS and DNA methylation.        OBJECTIVES: We examined associations of gestational PFAS exposure with longitudinal DNA methylation measures at birth and in adolescence using the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003-2006; Cincinnati, Ohio).        METHODS: We quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in mothers during pregnancy. We measured DNA methylation in cord blood (n =266) and peripheral leukocytes at 12 years of age (n =160) using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. We analyzed associations between log(2) -transformed PFAS concentrations and repeated DNA methylation measures using linear regression with generalized estimating equations. We included interaction terms between children's age and gestational PFAS. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways. We used Project Viva (1999-2002; Boston, Massachusetts) to replicate significant associations.        RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, 435 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites were associated with PFAS (false discovery rate, q < 0.05). Specifically, we identified 2 CpGs for PFOS, 12 for PFOA, 8 for PFHxS, and 413 for PFNA; none overlapped. Among these, 2 CpGs for PFOA and 4 for PFNA were replicated in Project Viva. Some of the PFAS-associated CpG sites annotated to gene regions related to cancers, cognitive health, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. We found little evidence that the associations between PFAS and DNA methylation differed by children's age.        DISCUSSION: In these longitudinal data, PFAS biomarkers were associated with differences in several CpGs at birth and at 12 years of age in or near genes linked to some PFAS-associated health outcomes. Future studies should examine whether DNA methylation mediates associations between gestational PFAS exposure and health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1289/EHP10118,AMMONIUM PERFLUOROOCTANOATE PRODUCTION;POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES;ACID        EXPOSURE;SERUM;PREGNANCY;DISEASE;EPIGENETICS;PREDICTORS;DISORDER;CHILDREN;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Pregnancy;Methylation,,

Significant and widespread differences in methylation levels of multiple regions within the genome have been reported between AUD patients and healthy controls in large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Also, within patient populations, methylation changes over time (both during and after withdrawal) have been identified as sensitive indicators for disease activity. The detection of changes in methylation levels is a powerful tool to further explore and understand the biological correlates and underpinnings of AUD. Although there is strong and convincing evidence for differences in methylation of various sites between AUD patients and controls, only few studies assessed changes within patients over longer periods of time while taking into account alcohol consumption, relapse, and abstinence. So far, the longest period assessed as a within-subject design using EWASs was 4 weeks.        Methods Here, we investigated changes in whole-genome methylation levels within a sample of 69 detoxified AUD patients over a period as long as 12 months for the first time, comparing patients that relapsed within the follow-up period to those that remained abstinent.        Results Whole-genome methylation patterns of individual CpG sites over time did not differ between abstinent and relapsing patients. However, there was a negative association between global mean methylation at the 12-month follow-up and alcohol consumption within our sample.        Conclusion Although the present study represents the largest study of methylation levels in a sample of AUD patients with a follow-up period of 1 year and accounting for alcohol consumption and relapse to date, the sample size might still not be large enough to detect genome-wide significant effects. Therefore, large-scale, long-term studies with AUD subjects are needed to determine the utility of DNA methylation for the assessment and monitoring of persons with alcohol use disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: alcohol",10.1111/acer.14354     EA MAY 2020,GENE-EXPRESSION;EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS;HISTONE MODIFICATIONS;USE        DISORDER;BLOOD;ASSOCIATION;VALIDATION;METABOLISM;BIOMARKER;DRINKING;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Longitudinal Studies;Alcoholics;Genome,,

Study design We performed a genome-wide methylation scan using the Illumina HumanMethylation 27 Bead-Chip on leukocyte DNA of 11 cases of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] <= 25 nmol/L) and 11 age-matched controls ([25(OH) D] > 75 nmol/L); the subjects were African American normal-weight (body mass index <85th percentile) males aged 14-19 years. The Limma package was used to analyze each CpG site for differential methylation between cases and controls. To correct for multiple testing, the set of raw P values were converted to false discovery rates (FDRs). We also compared our findings with the recent data from Genome-Wide Association Studies of circulating 25(OH) D levels and then performed a permutation test to examine whether the ""double hit"" genes were randomly enriched.        Results A total of 79 CpG sites achieved raw P<.001. Of the 79 CpG sites, 2 CpG sites survived multiple testing: cg16317961 (raw P = 3.5 x 10(-6), FDR = 0.078, in MAPRE2) and cg04623955 (raw P = 5.9 x 10(-6), FDR = 0.078, in DIO3). Furthermore, 3 out of the 4 genes previously identified in the 2 Genome-Wide Association Studies were also significant at the methylation level (DHCR7: cg07487535, P=.015 and cg10763288, P=.017; CYP2R1: cg25454890, P=.040; CYP24A1: cg18956481, P=.022), reflecting significant enrichment (P=.0098).

However, screening is invasive, expensive, and associated with significant morbidity making bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to treat per capita. There is an urgent need to expand the understanding of markers related to recurrence and survival outcomes of NMIBC. Methods and results We used the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array to measure peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of NMIBC patients (N = 603) enrolled in a population-based cohort study in New Hampshire and applied cell type deconvolution to estimate immune cell-type proportions. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we identified that increasing CD4T and CD8T cell proportions were associated with a statistically significant decreased hazard of tumor recurrence or death (CD4T: HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97-1.00; CD8T: HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-1.00), whereas increasing monocyte proportion and methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (mdNLR) were associated with the increased hazard of tumor recurrence or death (monocyte: HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.00-1.07; mdNLR: HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.20). Then, using an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) approach adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, BCG treatment status, and immune cell profiles, we identified 2528 CpGs associated with the hazard of tumor recurrence or death (P < 0.005). Among these CpGs, the 1572 were associated with an increased hazard and were significantly enriched in open sea regions; the 956 remaining CpGs were associated with a decreased hazard and were significantly enriched in enhancer regions and DNase hypersensitive sites.

We aimed to investigate the association and underlying causation between smoking and blood methylation.        Methods: The methylation profile of DNA from the peripheral blood, collected as dried blood spots stored on Guthrie cards, was measured for 479 Australian women including 66 monozygotic twin pairs, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of twins from 130 twin families using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip array. Linear regression was used to estimate associations between methylation at similar to 410,000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) and smoking status. A regression-based methodology for twins, Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding (ICE FALCON), was used to assess putative causation.        Results: At a 5% false discovery rate, 39 CpGs located at 27 loci, including previously reported AHRR, F2RL3, 2q37.1 and 6p21.33, were found to be differentially methylated across never, former and current smokers. For all 39 CpG sites, current smokers had the lowest methylation level. Our study provides the first replication for two previously reported CpG sites, cg06226150 (SLC2A4RG) and cg21733098 (12q24.32). From the ICE FALCON analysis with smoking status as the predictor and methylation score as the outcome, a woman's methylation score was associated with her co-twin's smoking status, and the association attenuated towards the null conditioning on her own smoking status, consistent with smoking status causing changes in methylation. To the contrary, using methylation score as the predictor and smoking status as the outcome, a woman's smoking status was not associated with her co-twin's methylation score, consistent with changes in methylation not causing smoking status.        Conclusions: For middle-aged women, peripheral blood DNA methylation at several genomic locations is associated with smoking. Our study suggests that smoking has a causal effect on peripheral blood DNA methylation, but not vice versa.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,smoking",10.1186/s13148-018-0452-9,HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY MEASURES;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;WIDE ASSOCIATION;BREAST-CANCER;LUNG-CANCER;LOCI;IDENTIFICATION;EPIGENETICS;DISCOVERY;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Twins,,

Leptin gene (LEP) is reported to be associated with body mass index (BMI). On the other hand, breastfeeding duration has been found to be associated with DNA methylation (DNAm) of the LEP gene. Therefore, epigenetic regulation of LEP may represent the mechanism underlying the protective effect of breastfeeding duration against obesity. Methods In the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort, peripheral blood DNAm at 23 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) in the LEP locus in 10-year-old (n = 297) samples and 16 CpGs in 18-year-old (n = 305) samples, were generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC and HumanMethylation450 Beadchips respectively and tested for association with breastfeeding duration (total and exclusive) using linear regression. To explore the association between breastfeeding durations and genome-wide DNAm, epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) and differential methylation region (DMR) analyses were performed. BMI trajectories spanning the first 18 years of life were used as the outcome to test the association with breastfeeding duration (exposure) using multi-nominal logistic regression. Mediation analysis was performed for significant CpG sites. Results Both total and exclusive breastfeeding duration were associated with DNAm at four LEP CpG sites at 10 years (P value < 0.05), and not at 18 years. Though no association was observed between breastfeeding duration and genome-wide DNAm, DMR analyses identified five significant differentially methylated regions (Sidak adjusted P value < 0.05). Breastfeeding duration was also associated with the early transient overweight trajectory. Furthermore, DNAm of LEP was associated with this trajectory at one CpG site and early persistent obesity at another, though mediation analysis was not significant. Conclusions Breastfeeding duration is associated with LEP methylation at age 10 years and BMI trajectory. LEP DNAm is also significantly associated with BMI trajectories throughout childhood, though sample sizes were small. However, mediation analysis did not demonstrate that DNAm of LEP explained the protective effect of breastfeeding against childhood obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: breastfeeding | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.1186/s13148-019-0727-9,"BODY-MASS INDEX;EARLY-CHILDHOOD;INFANT;AGE;NUTRITION;HEALTH;TRAJECTORIES;MECHANISMS;OUTCOMES;OBESITY;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Breast Feeding;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Leptin;Methylation;DNA",,

Recent evidence suggests that HIV infection may modulate changes in the host cell epigenome, and these changes represent a potential mechanism through which HIV infection accelerates aging. We assessed the difference in DNA methylation (DNAm) age, an aging marker involving multiple age-related cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, among antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in a cohort of veterans from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study.        Design: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 19 ART-naive, HIV-positive, and 19 HIV-negative male participants, matched by age and race. Blood samples were collected from HIV-positive participants 7-11 years after ART initiation.        Methods: We compared DNAm age between HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups at baseline and between HIV-positive patients at baseline and follow-up. We also performed an epigenome-wide analysis to identify CpG methylation sites associated with HIV infection.        Results: DNAm age in HIV-positive individuals is, on average, 11.2 years higher than HIV study participants at baseline, and two of 10 HIV-positive individuals showed an increase in DNAm age after ART initiation. Epigenome-wide association studies showed an association of HIV infection with one site, in gene VPS37B, which approached statistical significance in our cohort (P = 3.30 X 10(-6), Bonferroni-corrected threshold = 1.22 X 10(-7)) and was replicated in a second, larger cohort.        Conclusion: ART treatment-naive HIV-positive individuals have significantly older DNAm age compared to HIV-negative individuals in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study cohort.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Five cohort studies' participants (n = 8,270) were classified as statin users when they were on statin therapy at the time of DNAm assessment with Illumina 450K or EPIC array or noncurrent users otherwise. Associations of DNAm with various outcomes like incident type 2 diabetes, plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) as well as with gene expression were investigated. RESULTS Discovery (n = 6,820) and replication (n = 1,450) phases associated five DNAm sites with statin use: cg17901584 (1.12 x 10(-25) [DHCR24]), cg10177197 (3.94 x 10(-08) [DHCR24]), cg06500161 (2.67 x 10(-23) [ABCG1]), cg27243685 (6.01 x 10(-09) [ABCG1]), and cg05119988 (7.26 x 10(-12) [SC4MOL]). Two sites were associated with at least one glycemic trait or type 2 diabetes. Higher cg06500161 methylation was associated with higher fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.34 [95% CI 1.22, 1.47]). Mediation analyses suggested that ABCG1 methylation partially mediates the effect of statins on high insulin and HOMA-IR. Gene expression analyses showed that statin exposure and ABCG1 methylation were associated with ABCG1 downregulation, suggesting epigenetic regulation of ABCG1 expression.

CONCLUSIONS This study sheds light on potential mechanisms linking statins with type 2 diabetes risk, providing evidence on DNAm partially mediating statins' effects on insulin traits.

DNA methylation is not only an inherited but also modifiable epigenetic mark that has been related to cardiovascular risk factors. Our aim was to identify loci showing differential DNA methylation related to serum lipid levels. Blood DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip. A two-stage epigenome-wide association study was performed, with a discovery sample in the REGICOR study (n = 645) and validation in the Framingham Offspring Study (n = 2,542). Fourteen CpG sites located in nine genes (SREBF1, SREBF2, PHOSPHO1, SYNGAP1, ABCG1, CPT1A, MYLIP, TXNIP and SLC7A11) and 2 intergenic regions showed differential methylation in association with lipid traits. Six of these genes and 1 intergenic region were new discoveries showing differential methylation related to total cholesterol (SREBF2), HDLcholesterol (PHOSPHO1, SYNGAP1 and an intergenic region in chromosome 2) and triglycerides (MYLIP, TXNIP and SLC7A11). These CpGs explained 0.7%, 9.5% and 18.9% of the variability of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the Framingham Offspring Study, respectively. The expression of the genes SREBF2 and SREBF1 was inversely associated with methylation of their corresponding CpGs (P-value = 0.0042 and 0.0045, respectively) in participants of the GOLDN study ( n = 98). In turn, SREBF1 expression was directly associated with HDL cholesterol ( P-value = 0.0429). Genetic variants in SREBF1, PHOSPHO1, ABCG1 and CPT1A were also associated with lipid profile. Further research is warranted to functionally validate these new loci and assess the causality of new and established associations between these differentially methylated loci and lipid metabolism.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat",10.1093/hmg/ddw285,FAMILIAL COMBINED HYPERLIPIDEMIA;DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL;THIOREDOXIN INTERACTING PROTEIN;CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE;BODY-MASS        INDEX;LOWERING DRUGS;GENE PROMOTER;RISK-FACTORS;BLOOD;ASSOCIATION;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA,,

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may contribute. Individual pesticides may be associated with specific DNA methylation patterns but no epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) has evaluated methylation in relation to individual pesticides.        OBJECTIVES: We conducted an EWAS of DNA methylation in relation to several pesticide active ingredients.        METHODS: The Agricultural Lung Health Study is a case-control study of asthma, nested within the Agricultural Health Study. We analyzed blood DNA methylation measured using Illumina's EPIC array in 1,170 male farmers of European ancestry. For pesticides still on the market at blood collection (2009-2013), we evaluated nine active ingredients for which at least 30 participants reported past and current (within the last 12 months) use, as well as seven banned organochlorines with at least 30 participants reporting past use. We used robust linear regression to compare methylation at individual C-phosphate-G sites (CpGs) among users of a specific pesticide to never users.        RESULTS: Using family-wise error rate (p < 9 x 10(-8)) or false-discovery rate (FDR <0:05), we identified 162 differentially methylated CpGs across 8 of 9 currently marketed active ingredients (acetochlor, atrazine, dicamba, glyphosate, malathion, metolachlor, mesotrione, and picloram) and one banned organochlorine (heptachlor). Differentially methylated CpGs were unique to each active ingredient, and a dose-response relationship with lifetime days of use was observed for most. Significant CpGs were enriched for transcription motifs and 28% of CpGs were associated with whole blood cis-gene expression, supporting functional effects of findings. We corroborated a previously reported association between dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (banned in the United States in 1972) and epigenetic age acceleration.        DISCUSSION: We identified differential methylation for several active ingredients in male farmers of European ancestry. These may serve as biomarkers of chronic exposure and could inform mechanisms of long-term health outcomes from pesticide exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pesticide exposure",10.1289/EHP8928,"EXPOSURE;ASSOCIATION;ATRAZINE;NEURONS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Pesticides;Lung;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA",,

However, the results fromEWAS have been inconsistent, and longitudinal observations of these associations are scarce. Furthermore, few studies have investigated whether DNA methylation (DNAm) could be modified by smoking, drinking, and glycemic traits, which have broad impacts on genome-wide DNAm and result in altering the risk of T2DM. Twin studies provide a valuable tool for epigenetic studies, as twins are naturally matched for genetic information. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase for EWAS, and 214, 33, and 117 candidate CpG sites were selected for T2DM, HbA1c, and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Based on 1,070 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry, 67, 17, and 16 CpG sites from previous studies were validated for T2DM, HbA1c, and FBG. Longitudinal review and blood sampling for phenotypic information and DNAm were conducted twice in 2013 and 2018 for 308 twins. A crosslagged analysis was performed to examine the temporal relationship between DNAmand T2DMor glycemic traits in the longitudinal data. A total of 11 significant paths from T2DM to subsequent DNAm and 15 paths from DNAm to subsequent T2DM were detected, suggesting both directions of associations. For glycemic traits, we detected 17 cross-lagged associations from baseline glycemic traits tosubsequent DNAm, and none were from the other cross lagged direction, indicating that CpG sites may be the consequences, not the causes, of glycemic traits. Finally, a longitudinal mediation analysis was performed to explore the mediation effects of DNAmon the associations of smoking, drinking, and glycemic traits with T2DM. No significant mediations of DNAm in the associations linking smoking and drinking with T2DM were found. In contrast, our study suggested a potential role of DNAm of cg19693031, cg00574958, and cg04816311 in mediating the effect of altered glycemic traits on T2DM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.2337/db22-0513,"EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;MEDIATION ANALYSIS;BLOOD;EPIGENETICS;DISCORDANT;PATTERNS;GLUCOSE;MARKERS;PROTEIN;OBESITY;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Twins;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA",,

Independent GWA studies have identified genetic variants in the BACH2, IL6ST, LAMB1, IKZF1, and MGAT3 loci to be associated with both IBD and immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation.        Methods: Using bisulfite pyrosequencing, we analyzed CpG methylation in promoter regions of these five genes from peripheral blood of several hundred IBD patients and healthy controls (HCs) from two independent cohorts, respectively.        Results: We found significant differences in the methylation levels in the MGAT3 and BACH2 genes between both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis when compared to HC. The same pattern of methylation changes was identified for both genes in CD19(+) B cells isolated from the whole blood of a subset of the IBD patients. A correlation analysis was performed between the MGAT3 and BACH2 promoter methylation and individual IgG glycans, measured in the same individuals of the two large cohorts. MGAT3 promoter methylation correlated significantly with galactosylation, sialylation, and bisecting GlcNAc on IgG of the same patients, suggesting that activity of the GnT-III enzyme, encoded by this gene, might be altered in IBD. The correlations between the BACH2 promoter methylation and IgG glycans were less obvious, since BACH2 is not a glycosyltransferase and therefore may affect IgG glycosylation only indirectly.        Conclusions: Our results suggest that epigenetic deregulation of key glycosylation genes might lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory properties of IgG in IBD through a decrease in galactosylation and sialylation and an increase of bisecting GlcNAc on digalactosylated glycan structures. Finally, we showed that CpG methylation in the promoter of the MGAT3 gene is altered in CD3(+) T cells isolated from inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis from a third smaller cohort, for which biopsies were available, suggesting a functional role of this glyco-gene in IBD pathogenesis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-018-0507-y,GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;DNA METHYLATION;RISK LOCI;N-GLYCOSYLATION;EARLY-LIFE;IMMUNE;MECHANISMS;PROFILES;EXPOSURE;SMOKING;Methylation;Immunoglobulins;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,,

We performed covariate-adjusted epigenome-wide association meta-analysis and employed pathway and regional analyses of results. Seven-hundred and five methylation sites (505 genes) were significantly cross-sectionally associated with mid-childhood atopic sensitization, 1411 (905 genes) for environmental and 45 (36 genes) for food allergen sensitization (FDR<0.05). We observed differential methylation across multiple genes for all three phenotypes, including genes implicated previously in innate immunity (DICER1), eosinophilic esophagitis and sinusitis (SIGLEC8), the atopic march (AP5B1) and asthma (EPX, IL4, IL5RA, PRG2, SIGLEC8, CLU). In addition, most of the associated methylation marks for all three phenotypes occur in putative transcription factor binding motifs. Pathway analysis identified multiple methylation sites associated with atopic sensitization and environmental allergen sensitization located in/near genes involved in asthma, mTOR signaling, and inositol phosphate metabolism. We identified multiple differentially methylated regions associated with atopic sensitization (8 regions) and environmental allergen sensitization (26 regions). A number of nominally significant methylation sites in the cord blood analysis were epigenome-wide significant in the mid-childhood analysis, and we observed significant methylation - time interactions among a subset of sites examined.

DNA methylation plays a key role in gene regulation in many tissues, but its involvement in bone homeostasis is not well characterized, and no information is available regarding altered methylation in BRONJ. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay, we performed an epigenome-wide association study in peripheral blood samples from 68 patients treated with nitrogenous BP, including 35 with BRONJ. Analysis of the estimated cumulative BP exposure distribution indicated that the exposure of the case group to BP was slightly higher than that of the control group; more severely affected cases (i.e., with BRONJ in both mandible and maxilla) were significantly more exposed to BP than were those with BRONJ only in the mandible or maxilla (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the positive association between cumulative bisphosphonates exposure and risk of BRONJ (OR 1.015 per mg of cumulative exposure, 95%CI 1.004-1.032, p = 0.036). Although no statistically significant differences were observed between case and control groups, methylation levels of probes mapping on three genes, ERCC8, LEPREL1 and SDC2, were strongly associated with cumulative BP exposure levels (p < 1.31E-007). Enrichment analysis, combining differentially methylated genes with genes involved in the mevalonate pathway, showed that BP treatment can affect the methylation pattern of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses, leading to more frequent adverse effects such as BRONJ.

Epigenetic dysregulation including changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), may be involved in arsenic toxicity. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of arsenic exposure have been restricted to single populations and comparison across EWAS has been limited by methodological differences. Leveraging data from epidemiological studies conducted in Chile and Bangladesh, we use a harmonized data processing and analysis pipeline and meta-analysis to combine results from four EWAS. Methods DNAm was measured among adults in Chile with and without prenatal and early-life As exposure in PBMCs and buccal cells (N = 40, 850K array) and among men in Bangladesh with high and low As exposure in PBMCs (N = 32, 850K array; N = 48, 450K array). Linear models were used to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially variable positions (DVPs) adjusting for age, smoking, cell type, and sex in the Chile cohort. Probes common across EWAS were meta-analyzed using METAL, and differentially methylated and variable regions (DMRs and DVRs, respectively) were identified using comb-p. KEGG pathway analysis was used to understand biological functions of DMPs and DVPs. Results In a meta-analysis restricted to PBMCs, we identified one DMP and 23 DVPs associated with arsenic exposure; including buccal cells, we identified 3 DMPs and 19 DVPs (FDR < 0.05). Using meta-analyzed results, we identified 11 DMRs and 11 DVRs in PBMC samples, and 16 DMRs and 19 DVRs in PBMC and buccal cell samples. One region annotated to LRRC27 was identified as a DMR and DVR. Arsenic-associated KEGG pathways included lysosome, autophagy, and mTOR signaling, AMPK signaling, and one carbon pool by folate. Conclusions Using a two-step process of (1) harmonized data processing and analysis and (2) meta-analysis, we leverage four DNAm datasets from two continents of individuals exposed to high levels of As prenatally and during adulthood to identify DMPs and DVPs associated with arsenic exposure. Our approach suggests that standardizing analytical pipelines can aid in identifying biological meaningful signals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis,arsenic exposure",10.1186/s12940-021-00754-7,DRINKING-WATER;GENE-EXPRESSION;CORD BLOOD;NORTHERN CHILE;IN-UTERO;ASSOCIATIONS;PACKAGE;MORTALITY;DISCOVERY;PLACENTA;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,,

However, it remains unclear how antiretroviral therapy (ART) affects the HIV-induced epigenetic modifications.        Methods 184 individuals with HIV from the NEAT001/ANRS143 clinical trial (with pre-ART and post-ART samples [96 weeks of follow-up]) and 44 age-and-sex matched individuals without HIV were included. We compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in whole blood between groups adjusting for age, sex, batch effects, and DNA methylation-based estimates of leucocyte composition.        Findings We identified 430 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between HIV+ pre-ART individuals and HIV-uninfected controls. In participants with HIV, ART initiation modified the DNA methylation levels at 845 CpG positions and restored 49.3% of the changes found between HIV+ pre-ART and HIV-uninfected individuals. We only found 15 DMPs when comparing DNA methylation profiles between HIV+ post-ART individuals and participants without HIV. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of DMPs associated with untreated HIV infection revealed an enrichment in biological processes regulating the immune system and antiviral responses. In participants with untreated HIV infection, DNA methylation levels at top HIV-related DMPs were associated with CD4/CD8 ratios and viral loads. Changes in DNA methylation levels after ART initiation were weakly correlated with changes in CD4+ cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio.        Interpretation Control of HIV viraemia after 96 weeks of ART initiation partly restores the host DNA methylation changes that occurred before antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection.

As this condition is difficult to treat once present, identification of risk early in life can help inform and implement strategies to prevent the onset of the condition. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to prospectively investigate the relationship between cord blood DNA methylation and adiposity measurements in childhood.        Methods: We measured genome-wide DNA methylation from 478 children in cord blood and measured overall and central adiposity via skinfold caliper measurements in early (range 3.1-3.3 years) and mid-childhood (age range 7.3-8. 3 years) and via dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in mid-childhood. Final models were adjusted for maternal age at enrollment, pre-pregnancy body mass index, education, folate intake during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational weight gain, and child sex, race/ethnicity, current age, and cord blood cell composition.        Results: We identified four promoter proximal CpG sites that were associated with adiposity as measured by subscapular (SS) and triceps (TR) ratio (SS: TR) in early childhood, in the genes KPRP, SCL9A10, MYLK2, and PRLHR. We additionally identified one gene body CpG site associated with early childhood SS + TR on PPAPDC1A; this site was nominally associated with SS + TR in mid-childhood. Higher methylation at one promoter proximal CpG site in MMP25 was also associated with SS: TR in mid-childhood. In regional analyses, methylation at an exonal region of GFPT2 was positively associated with SS: TR in early childhood. Finally, we identified regions of two long, non-coding RNAs which were associated with SS: TR (LOC100049716) and fat-free mass index (LOC102723493) in mid-childhood.

The etiology associated with perinatal depressive psychopathology is poorly understood, but accumulating evidence suggests that understanding inter-individual differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterning may provide insight regarding the genomic regions salient to the risk liability of perinatal depressive psychopathology. Results Genome-wide DNAm was measured in maternal peripheral blood using the Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray. Ninety-two participants (46% African-American) had DNAm samples that passed all quality control metrics, and all participants were within 7 months of delivery. Linear models were constructed to identify differentially methylated sites and regions, and permutation testing was utilized to assess significance. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined as genomic regions of consistent DNAm change with at least two probes within 1 kb of each other. Maternal age, current smoking status, estimated cell-type proportions, ancestry-relevant principal components, days since delivery, and chip position served as covariates to adjust for technical and biological factors. Current postpartum depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Ninety-eight DMRs were significant (false discovery rate < 5%) and overlapped 92 genes. Three of the regions overlap loci from the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analysis of depression. Conclusions Many of the genes identified in this analysis corroborate previous allelic, transcriptomic, and DNAm association results related to depressive phenotypes. Future work should integrate data from multi-omic platforms to understand the functional relevance of these DMRs and refine DNAm association results by limiting phenotypic heterogeneity and clarifying if DNAm differences relate to the timing of onset, severity, duration of perinatal mental health outcomes of the current pregnancy or to previous history of depressive psychopathology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-019-0769-z,DSM-IV CRITERIA;MAJOR DEPRESSION;DISCOVERY;PREGNANCY;PROFILES;PACKAGE;BIOCONDUCTOR;STRESS;SYSTEM;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Genome;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

As DNA methylation is under both genetic and environmental control, we hypothesised that investigation of differential methylation associated with these phenotypes would permit mechanistic insights, and improve prediction of COPD. We investigated genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns using the recently released 850 K Illumina EPIC array. This is the largest single population, whole-genome epigenetic study to date.        Methods: Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of respiratory function and COPD were performed in peripheral blood samples from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) cohort (n = 3781: 274 COPD cases and 2919 controls). In independent COPD incidence data (n = 149), significantly differentially methylated sites (DMSs; p < 3.6 x 10(-8)) were evaluated for their added predictive power when added to a model including clinical variables, age, sex, height and smoking history using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) was used to replicate association (n = 895) and prediction = 178) results.        Findings: We identified 28 respiratory function and/or COPD associated DMSs, which mapped to genes involved in alternative splicing. JAK-SPAT signalling, and axon guidance. In prediction analyses, we observed significant improvement in discrimination between COPD cases and controls (p < .05) in independent GS:SFHS (p = .016) and LBC1936 (p = .010) datasets by adding DMSs to a clinical model.

While cigarette smoking is the primary cause of this malignancy, risk differs across racial/ethnic groups. For the same number of cigarettes smoked, Native Hawaiians compared to whites are at greater risk and Japanese Americans are at lower risk of developing lung cancer. DNA methylation of specific CpG sites (e.g., in AHRR and F2RL3) is the most common blood epigenetic modification associated with smoking status. However, the influence of internal smoking dose, measured by urinary nicotine equivalents (NE), on DNA methylation in current smokers has not been investigated, nor has a study evaluated whether for the same smoking dose, circulating leukocyte DNA methylation patterns differ by race.        Methods: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of NE in 612 smokers from three racial/ethnic groups: whites (n = 204), Native Hawaiians (n = 205), and Japanese Americans (n = 203). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of blood leukocyte DNA was measured using the Illumina 450K BeadChip array. Average beta value, the ratio of signal from a methylated probe relative to the sum of the methylated and unmethylated probes at that CpG, was the dependent variables in linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, race (for pan-ethnic analysis), and estimated cell-type distribution.        Results: We found that NE was significantly associated with six differentially methylated CpG sites (Bonferroni corrected p < 1.48 x 10-7): four in or near the FOXK2, PBX1, FNDC7, and FUBP3 genes and two in non-annotated genetic regions. Higher levels of NE were associated with increasing methylation beta-valuesin all six sites. For all six CpG sites, the association was only observed in Native Hawaiians, suggesting that the influence of smoking dose on DNA methylation patterns is heterogeneous across race/ethnicity (p interactions < 8.8 x 10-8). We found two additional CpG sites associated with NE in only Native Hawaiians.        Conclusions: In conclusion, internal smoking dose was associated with increased DNA methylation in circulating leukocytes at specific sites in Native Hawaiian smokers but not in white or Japanese American smokers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1186/s13148-018-0543-7,"HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;LUNG-CANCER;TOBACCO-SMOKE;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;DIFFERENT RISKS;ETHNIC/RACIAL GROUPS;URINARY METABOLITES;NICOTINE METABOLISM;HUMAN GENOME;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",,

We identified a total of 31 CpG sites where methylation level was associated with measures of glucose metabolism after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and estimated white blood cell proportions and correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) method (four for fasting glucose, seven for fasting insulin, 25 for homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]; B-H-adjusted p-values between 9.2x10(-5) and 0.047). In addition, DNA methylation at cg06500161 (annotated to ABCG1) was associated with all the aforementioned phenotypes and 2-hour glucose (B-H-adjusted p-values between 9.2x10(-5) and 3.0x10(-3)). Methylation status of additional three CpG sites showed an association with fasting insulin only after additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (B-H-adjusted p-values = 0.047). Overall, effect strengths were reduced by around 30% after additional adjustment for BMI, suggesting that this variable has an influence on the investigated phenotypes. Furthermore, we found significant associations between methylation status of 21 of the aforementioned CpG sites and 2-hour insulin in a subset of samples with seven significant associations persisting after additional adjustment for BMI. In a subset of 533 participants, methylation of the CpG site cg06500161 (ABCG1) was inversely associated with ABCG1 gene expression (B-H-adjusted p-value = 1.5x10(-9)). Additionally, we observed an enrichment of the top 1,000 CpG sites for diabetes-related canonical pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. In conclusion, our study indicates that DNA methylation and diabetes-related traits are associated and that these associations are partially BMI-dependent.

Modifications in child DNA methylation are discussed as an underlying mechanism for the association between prenatal depressive symptoms and alterations in child outcomes. However. formerly reported genome-wide associations have yet to be replicated.        METHODS: In an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), alterations of DNA methylation related to maternal prenatal depressive symptoms were investigated in buccal cell samples from 174 children (n = 52 exposed to prenatal depressive symptoms; 6-9 years old) of the German longitudinal study FRAMES-FRANCES. Whole blood samples from the independent, age-comparable ARIES subsample of the ARIES/ALSPAC study (n=641; n = 159 exposed to prenatal depressive symptoms; 7-8 years old) were examined as a confirmation sample. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. DNA methylation was analyzed with the Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChip. Modifications in single CpGs, regions, and biological pathways were investigated. Results were adjusted for age and birth outcomes as well as postnatal and current maternal depressive symptoms. Analyses were performed for the whole sample as well as separated for sex.        RESULTS: The EWAS yielded no differentially methylated CpG or region as well as no accordance between samples withstanding correction for multiple testing. In pathway analyses. no overlapping functional domain was found to be enriched for either sample. A comparison of current and former findings suggests some overlapping methylation modifications from infancy to childhood. Results suggest that there might be sex-specific differential methylation. which should be further investigated in additional studies.        CONCLUSIONS: The current. mainly nonsignificant, results challenge the assumption of consistent modifications of DNA methylation in children exposed to prenatal depressive symptoms. Despite the relatively small sample size used in this study, this lack of significant results may reflect diverse issues of environmental epigenetic studies. which need to be addressed in future research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal",10.1177/2516865720932146,SEX-DIFFERENCES;POSTNATAL DEPRESSION;PREGNANCY;STRESS;HEALTH;NR3C1;BIRTH;INDIVIDUALS;EXPRESSION;CHILDHOOD;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Genome;Genomics;Methylation,,

The extent to which low levels of smoke exposure among nonsmoking pregnant women relates to offspring DNA methylation is unknown.        OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate relationships between maternal prenatal plasma cotinine levels and DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood in newborns using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip.        METHODS: Participants from the Newborn Epigenetics Study cohort who reported not smoking during pregnancy had verified low levels of cotinine from maternal prenatal plasma (0 ng/mL to <4 ng/mL), and offspring epigenetic data from umbilical cord blood were included in this study (n = 79). Multivariable linear regression models were fit to the data, controlling for cell proportions, age, race, education, and parity. Estimates represent changes in response to any 1-ng/mL unit increase in exposure.        RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression models yielded 29,049 CpGs that were differentially methylated in relation to increases in cotinine at a 5% false discovery rate. Top CpGs were within or near genes involved in neuronal functioning (PRKG1, DLGAP2, BSG), carcinogenesis (FHIT, HSPC157) and inflammation (AGER). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggest cotinine was related to methylation of gene pathways controlling neuronal signaling, metabolic regulation, cell signaling and regulation, and cancer. Further, enhancers associated with transcription start sites were enriched in altered CpGs. Using an independent sample from the same study population (n =115), bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed with infant cord blood DNA for two genes within our top 20 hits (AGER and PRKG1). Results from pyrosequencing replicated epigenome results for PRKG1 (cg17079497, estimate = - 1.09, standard error (SE) = 0.45, p = 0.018) but not for AGER (cg09199225; estimate = - 0.16, SE = 0.21, p = 0.44).        DISCUSSION: Secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmoking women may alter DNA methylation in regions involved in development, carcinogenesis, and neuronal functioning. These novel findings suggest that even low levels of smoke exposure during pregnancy may be sufficient to alter DNA methylation in distinct sites of mixed umbilical cord blood leukocytes in pathways that are known to be altered in cord blood from pregnant active smokers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Maternal,cord blood",10.1289/EHP8099,MATERNAL SMOKING;SERUM COTININE;BIRTH-WEIGHT;NEWBORNS;DISCOVERY;BIOMARKER;REVEALS;REGIONS;COMPLEX;CANCER;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Pregnancy;Smoke;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

The etiology of CH and early SH in DS remains unclear. Previous research has shown genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in DS. Thus, we hypothesized that CH and early SH could be caused by epigenetically driven transcriptional downregulation of thyroid-related genes, through promoter region hypermethylation.Methods: We extracted whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of DS and non-DS individuals from four independent Illumina array-based datasets (252 DS individuals and 519 non-DS individuals). The data were divided into discovery and validation datasets. Epigenome-wide association analysis was performed using a linear regression model, after which we filtered results for thyroid-related genes.Results: In the discovery dataset, we identified significant associations for DS in 18 thyroid-related genes. Twenty-one of 30 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were also significant in the validation dataset. A meta-analysis of the discovery and validation datasets detected 31 DMPs, including 29 promoter-associated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) with identical direction of effect across the datasets, and two differentially methylated regions. Twenty-seven DMPs were hypomethylated and promoter associated. The mean methylation difference of hypomethylated thyroid-related DMPs decreased with age.Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis of generalized hypermethylation of promoter regions of thyroid-related genes-indicative of epigenetic silencing of promoters and subsequent transcriptional downregulation, causing biochemical thyroid abnormalities in DS-we found an enrichment of hypomethylated DMPs annotated to promoter regions of these genes. This suggests that CH and early SH in DS are not caused by differential methylation of thyroid-related genes. Considering that epigenetic regulation is dynamic, we hypothesize that the observed thyroid-related gene DNAm changes could be a rescue phenomenon in an attempt to ameliorate the thyroid phenotype, through epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes. This hypothesis is supported by the finding of decreasing methylation difference of thyroid-related genes with age. The prevalence of early SH declines with age, so hypothetically, epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes also diminishes. While this study provides interesting insights, the exact origin of CH and early SH in DS remains unknown.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1089/thy.2022.0320     EA DEC 2022,"CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM;THYROXINE TREATMENT;BLOOD-CELLS;CHILDREN;MOUSE;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, A-Form;DNA, B-Form;Methylation;DNA;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase",,

Here, we examined DNAm in diseased rectal mucosa from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, focusing on constituent cell types with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets for UC other than the immune system. We profiled DNAm of rectal mucosal biopsies of pediatric UC at diagnosis (n = 211) and non-IBD control (n = 85) patients and performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of specific cell types to understand DNAm changes in epithelial, immune and fibroblast cells across disease states, course, and clinical outcomes. We also examined longitudinal analysis on follow-up samples (n = 73), and comparisons were made among patients with clinical outcomes including those undergoing colectomy versus those who did not. Additionally, we included RNA-seq from the same subjects to assess the impact of CpG sites on the transcription of nearby genes during the disease course.Results At diagnosis, UC rectal mucosa exhibited a lower proportion of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and higher proportion of immune cells, in conjunction with variation in the DNAm pattern. While treatment had significant effects on the methylation signature of immune cells, its effects on fibroblasts and epithelial cells were attenuated. Individuals who required colectomy exhibited cell composition and DNAm patterns at follow-up more similar to disease onset than patients who did not require colectomy. Combining these results with gene expression profiles, we identify CpG sites whose methylation patterns are most consistent with a contribution to poor disease outcomes and could thus be potential therapeutic targets.Conclusions Cell-specific epigenetic changes in the rectal mucosa in UC are associated with disease severity and outcome.

We studied the association between maternal plasma POP concentration in early pregnancy and epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation among 260 pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. Results Our analysis focused on POPs with more than 80% plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification, including 3 organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor,p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 1 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 47), 3 polychlorinated biphenyls (138/158, 153, 180), and 6 poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA)). Using 5% false discovery rate, POPs were associated with a total of 214 differentially methylated CpG sites (nominalpvalues ranging from 2.61 x 10(-21)to 2.11 x 10(-7)). Out of the 214 CpG sites, 24 (11%) were significantly correlated with placental expression of 21 genes. Notably, higher PFUnDA was associated with increased methylation at 3 CpG sites (cg13996963, cg12089439, cg18145877) annotated toTUSC3, and increased methylation at those 3 CpG sites was correlated with decreased expression ofTUSC3in the placenta. Increased methylation at cg18145877 (TUSC3) and decreased expression ofTUSC3were correlated with shorter birth length. Out of the 214 CpG sites, methylation at 44 CpG sites was correlated (pvalue < 0.10) with at least one neonatal anthropometry measure (i.e., birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). Seven CpG sites mediated (pvalue < 0.05) the association between PBDE 47 and neonatal anthropometry measures. Genes annotating the top differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched in pathways related to differentiation of embryonic cells (PBDE 47) and in pathways related to brain size and brain morphology (PFASs).

Here, we performed EWAS analysis with longitudinally collected blood lipid data from survivors in the St. Jude lifetime cohort study.MethodsAmong 2052 childhood cancer survivors of European ancestry (EA) and 370 survivors of African ancestry (AA), four types of blood lipids, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG), were measured during follow-up beyond 5-years from childhood cancer diagnosis. For the exposure EWAS (i.e., lipids measured before blood draw for DNAm), the DNAm level was an outcome variable and each of the blood lipid level was an exposure variable; vice versa for the outcome EWAS (i.e., lipids measured after blood draw for DNAm).ResultsAmong EA survivors, we identified 43 lipid-associated CpGs in the HDL (n = 7), TC (n = 3), and TG (n = 33) exposure EWAS, and 106 lipid-associated CpGs in the HDL (n = 5), LDL (n = 3), TC (n = 4), and TG (n = 94) outcome EWAS. Among AA survivors, we identified 15 lipid-associated CpGs in TG exposure (n = 6), HDL (n = 1), LDL (n = 1), TG (n = 5) and TC (n = 2) outcome EWAS with epigenome-wide significance (P < 9 x 10(-8)). There were no overlapping lipids-associated CpGs between exposure and outcome EWAS among EA and AA survivors, suggesting that the DNAm changes of different CpGs could be the cause or consequence of blood lipid levels. In the meta-EWAS, 12 additional CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance. Notably, 32 out of 74 lipid-associated CpGs showed substantial heterogeneity (P-het < 0.1 or I-2 > 70%) between EA and AA survivors, highlighting differences in DNAm markers of blood lipids between populations with diverse genetic ancestry. Ten lipid-associated CpGs were cis-expression quantitative trait methylation with their DNAm levels associated with the expression of corresponding genes, out of which seven were negatively associated.ConclusionsWe identified distinct signatures of DNAm for blood lipids as exposures or outcomes and between EA and AA survivors, revealing additional genes involved in lipid metabolism and potential novel targets for controlling blood lipids in childhood cancer survivors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat",10.1186/s13148-023-01447-3,LONG-TERM;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;Survivors,,

However, no study has evaluated whether short-term temperature fluctuations could affect DNA methylation. Methods: Peripheral blood DNA methylation for 479 female siblings of 130 families were analysed. Gridded daily temperatures data were obtained, linked to each participant's home address, and used to calculate nine different metrics of short-term temperature fluctuations: temperature variabilities (TVs) within the day of blood draw and preceding one to seven days (TV 0-1 to TV 0-7), diurnal temperature range (DTR), and temperature change between neighbouring days (TCN). Within-sibship design was used to perform epigenome-wide association analyses, adjusting for daily mean temperatures, and other important covariates (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, celltype proportions). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were further identified. Multiple-testing comparisons with a significant threshold of 0.01 for cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) and 0.05 for DMRs were applied. Results: Among 479 participants (mean age +/- SD, 56.4 +/- 7.9 years), we identified significant changes in methylation levels in 14 CpGs and 70 DMRs associated with temperature fluctuations. Almost all identified CpGs were associated with exposure to temperature fluctuations within three days. Differentially methylated signals were mapped to 68 genes that were linked to human diseases such as cancer (e.g., colorectal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and metastatic neoplasms) and mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, mental depression, and bipolar disorder). The top three most significantly enriched gene ontology terms were Response to bacterium (TV 0-3), followed by Hydrolase activity, acting on ester bonds (TCN), and Oxidoreductase activity (TV 0-3). Conclusions: Short-term temperature fluctuations were associated with differentially methylated signals across the human genome, which provides evidence on the potential biological mechanisms underlying the health impact of temperature fluctuations. Future studies are needed to further clarify the roles of DNA methylation in diseases associated with temperature fluctuations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ambient temperature",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107655,BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;DNA METHYLATION;RESPONSES;Epigenomics;Temperature,,

Cord blood DNA methylation was measured by Illumina HumanMethylation 450K in one subset (N = 189) and EPI-Carray in another (N = 349). High (vegetation height>3 m (m)), low (vegetation height<3 m) and total (including both) high-resolution green space exposures during pregnancy were estimated within 100 m and 1000 m distance around maternal residence. In each subset, we sought cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites via linear mixed models adjusted on newborns' sex, ethnicity, gestational age, season at delivery, sampling day, maternal parity, age, smoking, education, and estimated blood cell proportions. EWASs results were meta -analysed via fixed-effects meta-analyses. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified via ENmix-combp and DMRcate algorithms. Sensitivity analyses were additionally adjusted on PM2.5, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income. In the 450K subset, cord blood expression of differentially meth-ylated genes was measured by Agilent microarrays and associated with green space.Results: 147 DMRs were identified, 85 of which were still significant upon adjustment for PM2.5, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income, including HLA-DRB5, RPTOR, KCNQ1DN, A1BG-AS1, HTR2A, ZNF274, COL11A1 and PRSS36 DMRs.

DNA methylation may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the adverse effects of prenatal lead on the offspring, but epigenome-wide methylation data for low levels of prenatal lead exposure are lacking.        OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between prenatal maternal lead exposure and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in umbilical cor nucleated cells in Project Viva, a prospective U.S.-based prebirth cohort with relatively low levels of lead exposure.        METHODS: Among 268 mother infant pairs, we measured lead concentrations in red blood cells (RBC) from prenatal maternal blood samples, and using HumanMethylation450 Bead Chips, we measured genome-wide methylation levels at 482,397 CpG loci in umbilical cord blood and retained 394,460 loci after quality control. After adjustment for batch effects, cell types, and covariates, we used robust linear regression models to examine associations of prenatal lead exposure with DNA methylation in cord blood at epigenome-wide significance level [false discovery rate (FDR) <00.5].        RESULTS: The mean [standard deviation(SD)] maternal RBC lead level was 1.22 (0.63) mu g/dL. CpG cg10773601 showed an epigenome-wide significant negative association with prenatal lead exposure (-1.4% per doubling increase in lead exposure; p =2.3 x 10(-7)) and was annotated to C-Type Lectin Domain Family 11, Member A (CLEC1 1A), which functions as a growth factor for primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. In sex-specific analyses, we identified more CpGs with FDR <0.05 among female infants (n=38) than among male infants (n = 2). One CpG (cg24637308), which showed a strong negative association with prenatal lead exposure among female infants (-4.3% per doubling increase in lead exposure; p= 1.1 x 10(-06)), was annotated to Dynein Heavy Chain Domain 1 gene (DNHD1) which is highly expressed in human brain. Interestingly, there were strong correlations between blood and brain methylation for CpG (cg24637308) based on another independent set of samples with a high proportion of female participants.

In addition to genetic risk factors, epigenetic mechanisms triggered by changing environment are investigated for their role in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have revealed significant associations of T2D, obesity, and BMI with DNA methylation. However, populations from the Middle East, where T2D and obesity rates are highest worldwide, have not been investigated so far.        Methods: We performed the first EWAS in an Arab population with T2D and BMI and attempted to replicate 47 EWAS associations previously reported in Caucasians. We used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to quantify DNA methylation in whole blood DNA from 123 subjects of 15 multigenerational families from Qatar. To investigate the effect of differing genetic background and environment on the epigenetic associations, we further assessed the effect of replicated loci in 810 twins from UK.        Results: Our EWAS suggested a novel association between T2D and cg06721411 (DQX1; p value = 1.18 x 10(-9)). We replicated in the Qatari population seven CpG associations with BMI (SOCS3, p value = 3.99 x 10(-6); SREBF1, p value = 4.33 x 10(-5); SBNO2, p value = 5.87 x 10(-5); CPT1A, p value = 7.99 x 10-5; PRR5L, p value = 1.85 x 10(-4); cg03078551, intergenic region on chromosome 17; p value = 1.00 x 10(-3); LY6G6E, p value = 1.10 x 10(-3)) and one with T2D (TXNIP, p value = 2.46 x 10(-5)). All the associations were further confirmed in the UK cohort for both BMI and T2D. Meta-analysis increased the significance of the observed associations and revealed strong heterogeneity of the effect sizes (apart from CPT1A), although associations at these loci showed concordant direction in the two populations.        Conclusions: Our study replicated eight known CpG associations with T2D or BMI in an Arab population. Heterogeneity of the effects at all loci except CPT1A between the Qatari and UK studies suggests that the underlying mechanisms might depend on genetic background and environmental pressure. Our EWAS results provide a basis for comparison with other ethnicities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat,Meta-analysis",10.1186/s13148-016-0177-6,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;DNA METHYLATION MARKERS;INSULIN-RESISTANCE;GENE-EXPRESSION;PERIPHERAL-BLOOD;LIPID EXPOSURE;ADIPOSE-TISSUE;SOCS-3;OBESITY;AGE;Arabs;Epigenomics,,

However, DNA methylation and the lipid compositions and lipid concentrations of lipoprotein sizes have been scarcely studied. Here, we present an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) (N = 5414 total) of mostly lipid-related metabolic measures, including a fine profiling of lipoproteins. As lipoproteins are the main players in the different stages of lipid metabolism, examination of epigenetic markers of detailed lipoprotein features might improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of metabolic disturbances.        Results: We conducted an EWAS of leukocyte DNA methylation and 226 metabolic measurements determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the population-based KORA F4 study (N = 1662) and replicated the results in the LOLIPOP, NFBC1966, and YFS cohorts (N = 3752). Follow-up analyses in the discovery cohort included investigations into gene transcripts, metabolic-measure ratios for pathway analysis, and disease endpoints. We identified 161 associations (p value < 4.7 x 10(-10)), covering 16 CpG sites at 11 loci and 57 metabolic measures. Identified metabolic measures were primarily medium and small lipoproteins, and fatty acids. For apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, the associations mainly involved triglyceride composition and concentrations of cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free cholesterol, and phospholipids. All associations for HDL lipoproteins involved triglyceride measures only. Associated metabolic measure ratios, proxies of enzymatic activity, highlight amino acid, glucose, and lipid pathways as being potentially epigenetically implicated. Five CpG sites in four genes were associated with differential expression of transcripts in blood or adipose tissue. CpG sites in ABCG1 and PHGDH showed associations with metabolic measures, gene transcription, and metabolic measure ratios and were additionally linked to obesity or previous myocardial infarction, extending previously reported observations.        Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of a link between DNA methylation and the lipid compositions and lipid concentrations of different lipoprotein size subclasses, thus offering in-depth insights into well-known associations of DNA methylation with total serum lipids. The results support detailed profiling of lipid metabolism to improve the molecular understanding of dyslipidemia and related disease mechanisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body fat",10.1186/s13148-020-00957-8,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;MAGNETIC-RESONANCE METABOLOMICS;BODY-MASS        INDEX;GENE-EXPRESSION;BLOOD-LIPIDS;FATTY-ACIDS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;MECHANISMS;DISEASE;G1;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Lipid Metabolism;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

This study simultaneously investigated associations of smoking-associated and LC-related methylation markers with LC mortality. DNA methylation was determined by HM450K assay in baseline blood samples of 1,565 older adults in a population-based case-cohort study. The associations of 151 smoking-associated CpGs (smoCpGs) and 3,806 LC-related CpGs (caCpGs) with LC mortality were assessed by weighted Cox regression models, controlling for potential confounders. Multi-loci methylation scores were separately constructed based on smoCpGs and caCpGs. During a median follow-up of 13.8 years, 60 participants who had a first diagnosis of LC died from LC. The average time between sample collection and LC diagnosis was 5.8 years. Hypomethylation at 77 smoCpGs and 121 caCpGs, and hypermethylation at 4 smoCpGs and 66 caCpGs were associated with LC mortality. The associations were much stronger for smoCpGs than for caCpGs. Hazard ratios (95% CI) were 7.82 (2.91-21.00) and 2.27 (0.75-6.85), respectively, for participants in highest quartile of Score I (based on 81 smoCpGs) and Score II (based on 187 caCpGs), compared with participants in the corresponding lower three quartiles. Score I outperformed Score II, with an optimism-corrected C-index of 0.87 vs. 0.77. In conclusion, although methylation changes of both smoking-associated and LC-related genes are associated with LC mortality, only smoking-associated methylation markers predict LC mortality with high accuracy, and may thus serve as promising candidates to identify high risk populations for LC screening.        What's new? Smoking related DNA methylation patterns are distinct from methylation patterns observed in lung cancer patients. With increased knowledge of associations with lung cancer, such patterns potentially could be used to improve lung cancer detection and risk stratification. This study shows that DNA methylation of both smoking-related and lung cancer-related genes in blood samples prospectively collected on average 5.8 years before lung cancer diagnosis are associated with lung cancer mortality. A multi-loci score based on smoking-associated methylation sites, however, significantly outperformed the lung cancer gene methylation score in predicting lung cancer death. Smoking-associated methylation markers could have a critical role in lung cancer screening.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,smoking | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No EWAS",10.1002/ijc.30374,RISK PREDICTION;CELLS;ADENOCARCINOMA;DIAGNOSIS;BIOMARKER;MODELS;SITES;SHOX2;LOCI;TIME;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,,

An age-stratified analysis examined if effects attenuate with age (median split at 10 years; n(<10) = 517, mean age = 7.9; n(>10) = 489, mean age = 11.2). We performed replication analyses in two independent cohorts from the NTR (buccal cells) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (peripheral blood), and we tested loci previously associated with breastfeeding in epigenetic studies. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in the NTR and with the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip in the ALSPAC. The duration of breastfeeding was dichotomized ('never' vs. 'ever'). In the total sample, no robustly associated epigenome-wide significant CpGs were identified (alpha = 6.34 x 10(-8)). In the sub-group of children younger than 10 years, four significant CpGs were associated with breastfeeding after adjusting for child and maternal characteristics. In children older than 10 years, methylation differences at these CpGs were smaller and non-significant. The findings did not replicate in the NTR sample (n = 98; mean age = 7.5 years), and no nearby sites were associated with breastfeeding in the ALSPAC study (n = 938; mean age = 7.4). Of the CpG sites previously reported in the literature, three were associated with breastfeeding in children younger than 10 years, thus showing that these CpGs are associated with breastfeeding in buccal and blood cells. Our study is the first to show that breastfeeding is associated with epigenetic variation in buccal cells in children. Further studies are needed to investigate if methylation differences at these loci are caused by breastfeeding or by other unmeasured confounders, as well as what mechanism drives changes in associations with age.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No Blood samples",10.3390/nu11112804,GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;BONE-MINERAL DENSITY;DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS;EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS;LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS;PRENATAL EXPOSURE;MATERNAL SMOKING;GENE-EXPRESSION;BLOOD;RISK;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

A diagnosis of CP cannot usually be made at birth and in some cases may be delayed until 2-3 years of age. This limits opportunities for early intervention that could otherwise improve long-term outcomes. CP has been recorded in monozygotic twins discordant for the disorder, indicating a potential role of non-genetic factors such as intrauterine infection, hypoxia-ischaemia, haemorrhage and thrombosis. The aim of this exploratory study was to utilise the discordant monozygotic twin model to understand and measure epigenetic changes associated with the development of CP.        Methods: We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip array with DNA from newborn blood spots of 15 monozygotic twin pairs who later became discordant for CP. Quality control and data preprocessing were undertaken using the minfi R package. Differential methylation analysis was performed using the remove unwanted variation (RUVm) method, taking twin pairing into account in order to identify CP-specific differentially methylated probes (DMPs), and bumphunter was performed to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs).        Results: We identified 33 top-ranked DMPs based on a nominal p value cut-off of p < 1 x 10 (4) and two DMRs (p < 1 x 10 (3)) associated with CP. The top-ranked probes related to 25 genes including HNRNPL, RASSF5, CD3D and KALRN involved in immune signalling pathways, in addition to TBC1D24, FBXO9 and VIPR2 previously linked to epileptic encephalopathy. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of top-ranked DMP-associated genes revealed enrichment of inflammatory signalling pathways, regulation of cytokine secretion and regulation of leukocyte-mediated immunity. We also identified two top-ranked DMRs including one on chromosome 6 within the promoter region of LTA gene encoding tumour necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta), an important regulator of inflammation and brain development. The second was within the transcription start site of the LIME1 gene, which plays a key role in inflammatory pathways such as MAPK signalling. CP-specific differential DNA methylation within one of our two top DMRs was validated using an independent platform, MassArray EpiTyper.        Conclusions: Ours is the first epigenome-wide association study of CP in disease-discordant monozygotic twin pairs and suggests a potential role for immune dysfunction in this condition.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s13148-018-0457-4,"TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR;EPIGENETIC CHANGES;BRAIN-DAMAGE;DISEASE;ASSOCIATION;CHILDREN;BIRTH;EXPRESSION;TISSUE;CLASSIFICATION;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Infant, Newborn;Cerebral Palsy",,

Blood DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many other environmental exposures, but to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between blood DNA methylation and glyphosate exposure.        OBJECTIVE: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with urinary glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) levels. Secondary goals were to determine the association of epigenetic age acceleration with glyphosate and AMPA and develop blood DNA methylation indices to predict urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels.        METHODS: For 392 postmenopausal women, white blood cell DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in two urine samples per participant using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methylation differences at the probe and regional level associated with glyphosate and AMPA levels were assessed using a resampling-based approach. Probes and regions that had an false discovery rate q< 0.1 in >= 90% of 1,000 subsamples of the study population were considered differentially methylated. Differentially methylated sites from the probe-specific analysis were combined into a methylation index. Epigenetic age acceleration from three epigenetic clocks and an epigenetic measure of pace of aging were examined for associations with glyphosate and AMPA.        RESULTS: We identified 24 CpG sites whose methylation level was associated with urinary glyphosate concentration and two associated with AMPA. Four regions, within the promoters of the MSH4, KCNA6, ABAT, and NDUFAF2/ERCC8 genes, were associated with glyphosate levels, along with an association between ESR1 promoter hypomethylation and AMPA. The methylation index accurately predicted glyphosate levels in an internal validation cohort. AMPA, but not glyphosate, was associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration.        DISCUSSION: Glyphosate and AMPA exposure were associated with DNA methylation differences that could promote the development of cancer and other diseases. Further studies are warranted to replicate our results, determine the functional impact of glyphosate- and AMPA-associated differential DNA methylation, and further explore whether DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker of glyphosate exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,herbicide",10.1289/EHP10174,BIOMARKER;ADULTS;TIME;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Postmenopause;DNA,,

We summarize 7 analytical approaches to the GAW20 data sets that addressed challenges and potential applications of phenotypic and epigenetic data. All contributions used the GAW20 real data set and employed either linear mixed effect (LME) models or marginal models through generalized estimating equations (GEE). These contributions were subdivided into 3 categories: (a) quality control (QC) methods for DNA methylation data; (b) heritability estimates pretreatment and posttreatment with fenofibrate; and (c) impact of drug response pretreatment and posttreatment with fenofibrate on DNA methylation and blood lipids.        Results: Two contributions addressed QC and identified large statistical differences with pretreatment and posttreatment DNA methylation, possibly a result of batch effects. Two contributions compared epigenome-wide heritability estimates pretreatment and posttreatment, with one employing a Bayesian LME and the other using a variance-component LME. Density curves comparing these studies indicated these heritability estimates were similar. Another contribution used a variance-component LME to depict the proportion of heritability resulting from a genetic and shared environment. By including environmental exposures as random effects, the authors found heritability estimates became more stable but not significantly different. Two contributions investigated treatment response. One estimated drug-associated methylation effects on triglyceride levels as the response, and identified 11 significant cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites with or without adjusting for high-density lipoprotein. The second contribution performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis and identified 6 significant modules of at least 30 CpG sites, including 3 modules with topological differences pretreatment and posttreatment.        Conclusions: Four conclusions from this GAW20 working group are: (a) QC measures are an important consideration for EWAS studies that are investigating multiple time points or repeated measurements; (b) application of heritability estimates between time points for individual CpG sites is a useful QC measure for DNA methylation studies; (c) drug intervention demonstrated strong epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns across the 2 time points; and (d) new statistical methods are required to account for the environmental contributions of DNA methylation across time. These contributions demonstrate numerous opportunities exist for the analysis of longitudinal data in future epigenetic studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1186/s12863-018-0648-1,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;LIPID-LOWERING DRUGS;DNA METHYLATION;GENETICS;APOLIPOPROTEIN;MODELS;Epigenomics,,

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on anxiety in a population-based cohort and validated our finding in a clinical cohort as well as a murine model. In the KORA cohort, participants (n = 1522, age 32-72 years) were administered the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) instrument, whole blood DNA methylation was measured (Illumina 450K BeadChip), and circulating levels of hs-CRP and IL-18 were assessed in the association between anxiety and methylation. DNA methylation was measured using the same instrument in a study of patients with anxiety disorders recruited at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP, 131 non-medicated cases and 169 controls). To expand our mechanistic understanding, these findings were reverse translated in a mouse model of acute social defeat stress. In the KORA study, participants were classified according to mild, moderate, or severe levels of anxiety (29.4%/6.0%/1.5%, respectively). Severe anxiety was associated with 48.5% increased methylation at a single CpG site (cg12701571) located in the promoter of the gene encoding Asb1 (beta-coefficient = 0.56 standard error (SE) = 0.10, p (Bonferroni) = 0.005), a protein hypothetically involved in regulation of cytokine signaling. An interaction between IL-18 and severe anxiety with methylation of this CpG cite showed a tendency towards significance in the total population (p = 0.083) and a significant interaction among women (p = 0.014). Methylation of the same CpG was positively associated with Panic and Agoraphobia scale (PAS) scores (beta = 0.005, SE = 0.002, p = 0.021, n = 131) among cases in the MPIP study. In a murine model of acute social defeat stress, Asb1 gene expression was significantly upregulated in a tissue-specific manner (p = 0.006), which correlated with upregulation of the neuroimmunomodulating cytokine interleukin 1 beta. Our findings suggest epigenetic regulation of the stress-responsive Asb1 gene in anxiety-related phenotypes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the causal direction of this association and the potential role of Asb1-mediated immune dysregulation in anxiety disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No environmental factor",10.1038/npp.2017.102,CYTOKINE SIGNALING SOCS;DNA METHYLATION;PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS;NEGATIVE REGULATORS;DEPRESSIVE-LIKE;ANKYRIN REPEAT;PANIC DISORDER;STRESS;GENE;INFLAMMATION;Methylation;Anxiety,,

In particular, recent studies have shown poor correlation of measured DNA methylation (DNAm) levels within and across Illumina Infinium platforms in various tissues. In this study, we have investigated concordance between 450 k and EPIC Infinium platforms in cord blood. We could not replicate our previous findings on the association of prenatal paracetamol exposure with cord blood DNAm, which prompted an investigation of cross-platform DNAm differences.        Results: This study is based on two DNAm data sets from cord blood samples selected from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). DNAm of one data set was measured using the 450 k platform and the other data set was measured using the EPIC platform. Initial analyses of the EPIC data could not replicate any of our previous significant findings in the 450 k data on associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and cord blood DNAm. A subset of the samples (n = 17) was included in both data sets, which enabled analyses of technical sources potentially contributing to the negative replication. Analyses of these 17 samples with repeated measurements revealed high per-sample correlations ((R) over tilde-approximate to 0.24) between the platforms. 1.7% of the CpGs exhibited a mean DNAm difference across platforms > 0.1. Furthermore, only 26.7% of the CpGs exhibited a moderate or better cross-platform reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient >= 0.5).        Conclusion: The observations of low cross-platform probe correlation and reliability corroborate previous reports in other tissues. Our study cannot determine the origin of the differences between platforms. Nevertheless, it emulates the setting in studies using data from multiple Infinium platforms, often analysed several years apart. Therefore, the findings may have important implications for future epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs), in replication, meta-analyses and longitudinal studies. Cognisance and transparency of the challenges related to cross-platform studies may enhance the interpretation, replicability and validity of EWAS results both in cord blood and other tissues, ultimately improving the clinical relevance of epigenetic epidemiology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: cord blood",10.1186/s13148-022-01299-3,"PROBE DESIGN BIAS;NORWEGIAN MOTHER;COHORT PROFILE;CHILD COHORT;PREGNANT-WOMEN;EPIGENETICS;450K;ANTIPSYCHOTICS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;ASSOCIATIONS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Fetal Blood;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",,

Given the direct exposure of buccal cells to potent carcinogens such as smoke, epigenetic changes in these cells may provide insights into the development of smoke-related cancers.        OBJECTIVE To perform an EWAS in buccal and blood cells to assess the relative effect of smoking on the DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns in these cell types and to test whether these DNAme changes are also seen in epithelial cancer.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In 2013, we measured DNAme at more than 480 000 CpG sites in buccal samples provided in 1999 by 790 women (all aged 53 years in 1999) from the United Kingdom Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development. This included matched blood samples from 152 women. We constructed a DNAme-based smoking index and tested its sensitivity and specificity to discriminate normal from cancer tissue in more than 5000 samples.        MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES CpG sites whose DNAme level correlates with smoking pack-years, and construction of an associated sample-specific smoking index, which measures the mean deviation of DNAme at smoking-associated CpG sites from a normal reference.        RESULTS In a discovery set of 400 women, we identified 1501 smoking-associated CpG sites at a genome-wide significance level of P < 10(-7), which were validated in an independent set of 390 women. This represented a 40-fold increase of differentially methylated sites in buccal cells compared with matched blood samples. Hypermethylated sites were enriched for bivalently marked genes and binding sites of transcription factors implicated in DNA repair and chromatin architecture (P < 10(-10)). A smoking index constructed from the DNAme changes in buccal cells was able to discriminate normal tissue from cancer tissue with a mean receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.99 (range, 0.99-1.00) for lung cancers and of 0.91 (range, 0.71-1.00) for 13 other organs. The corresponding area under the curve of a smoking signature derived from blood cells was lower than that derived from buccal cells in 14 of 15 cancer types (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = .001).

Multiple lines of evidence have linked DNA methylation to both cardiovascular risk factors and social disadvantage indicators. However, limited research has investigated the role of DNA methylation in mediating the associations of individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage with multiple cardiovascular risk factors in large, multi-ethnic, population-based cohorts. We examined whether disadvantage at the individual level (childhood and adult SES) and neighborhood level (summary neighborhood SES as assessed by Census data and social environment as assessed by perceptions of aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion) were associated with 11 cardiovascular risk factors including measures of obesity, diabetes, lipids, and hypertension in 1,154 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). For significant associations, we conducted epigenome-wide mediation analysis to identify methylation sites mediating the relationship between individual/neighborhood disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors using the JT-Comp method that assesses sparse mediation effects under a composite null hypothesis. In models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, medication use, and genetic principal components of ancestry, epigenetic mediation was detected for the associations of adult SES with body mass index (BMI), insulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as for the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C at FDR q < 0.05. The 410 CpG mediators identified for the SES-BMI association were enriched for CpGs associated with gene expression (expression quantitative trait methylation loci, or eQTMs), and corresponding genes were enriched in antigen processing and presentation pathways. For cardiovascular risk factors other than BMI, most of the epigenetic mediators lost significance after controlling for BMI. However, 43 methylation sites showed evidence of mediating the neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C association after BMI adjustment. The identified mediators were enriched for eQTMs, and corresponding genes were enriched in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Our findings support the hypothesis that DNA methylation acts as a mediator between individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors, and shed light on the potential underlying epigenetic pathways. Future studies are needed to fully elucidate the biological mechanisms that link social disadvantage to poor cardiovascular health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: socioeconomic status,neighborhood disadvantage | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not updated environmental exposure",10.3389/fcvm.2022.848768,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE;COURSE        SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;BODY-MASS INDEX;ADIPOSE-TISSUE;MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION;INCIDENT HYPERTENSION;ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY;GENE-EXPRESSION;BLOOD-PRESSURE;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

The EWAS identified methylation of 3 CpG sites to be significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms: cg04987734 (P = 1.57 x 10(-)(08); n = 11 256; CDC42BPB gene), cg12325605 (P = 5.24 x 10(-09); n = 11256; ARHGEF3 gene), and an intergenic CpG site cg14023999 (P = 5.99 x 10(-)(08); n = 11256; chromosome = 15q261). The predicted expression of the CDC42BPB gene in the brain (basal ganglia) (effect, 0.14; P = 2.7 x 10(-03)) and of ARHGEF3 in fibroblasts (effect. -0.48; P = 9.8 x 10(-)(04) ) was associated with major depression.        CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study identifies 3 methylated sites associated with depressive symptoms. All 3 findings point toward axon guidance as the common disrupted pathway in depression. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex pathophysiology of depression. Further research is warranted to determine the utility of these findings as biomarkers of depression and evaluate any potential role in the pathophysiology of depression and their downstream clinical effects.
