Investigation of greenness-related DNA methylation profiles can contribute to mechanistic understanding of the health benefits of residential greenness. OBJECTIVE: To identify DNA methylation profiles associated with greenness in the immediate surroundings of the residence. METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 1938 blood samples (982 participants) from the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). We estimated residential greenness based on normalized difference vegetation index at 30 × 30 m cell (green30) and 500 m buffer (green500) around the residential address. We conducted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify differentially methylated CpGs and regions, and enrichment tests by comparing to the CpGs that previous EWAS identified as associated with allergy, physical activity, and allostatic load-relevant biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified no genome-wide significant CpGs, but 163 and 56 differentially methylated regions for green30 and green500, respectively. Green30-related DNA methylation profiles showed enrichments in allergy, physical activity, and allostatic load, while green500-related methylation was enriched in allergy and allostatic load. CONCLUSIONS: Residential greenness may have health impacts through allergic sensitization, stress coping, or behavioral changes. Exposure to more proximal greenness may be more health-relevant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: greeness",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106945,"*Air Pollution;Cohort Studies;DNA;*DNA Methylation;Epigenome;Humans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;Methylation",34689037,

We aimed to evaluate the association between surrounding greenness and genome-wide DNA methylation and potential gene-greenness interaction effects on DNA methylation. METHODS: We measured blood-derived DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina) for 479 Australian women, including 66 monozygotic, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of these twins. Surrounding greenness was represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) within 300, 500, 1000 or 2000 m surrounding participants' home addresses. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), the associations between its methylation level and NDVI or EVI were evaluated by generalized estimating equations, after adjusting for age, education, marital status, area-level socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, cell-type proportions, and familial clustering. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For each significant CpG, we evaluated the interaction effects of greenness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±1 Mb window on its methylation level. RESULTS: We found associations between surrounding greenness and blood DNA methylation for one CpG (cg04720477, mapped to the promoter region of CNP gene) with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05, and for another 9 CpGs with 0.05 ≤ FDR < 0.10. For two of these CpGs, we found 33 SNPs significantly (FDR < 0.05) modified the greenness-methylation association. There were 35 significant DMRs related to surrounding greenness that were identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Those CpGs and DMRs were mapped to genes related to many human diseases, such as mental health disorders and neoplasms as well as nutritional and metabolic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Surrounding greenness was associated with blood DNA methylation of many loci across human genome, and this association could be modified by genetic variations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: greeness",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106556,"Australia;*DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenome;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Humans;Smoking;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation",33862401,

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may provide novel biomarkers of alcohol use. To examine this possibility, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of methylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in relation to alcohol intake in 13 population-based cohorts (n(total)=13 317; 54% women; mean age across cohorts 42-76 years) using whole blood (9643 European and 2423 African ancestries) or monocyte-derived DNA (588 European, 263 African and 400 Hispanic ancestry) samples. We performed meta-analysis and variable selection in whole-blood samples of people of European ancestry (n=6926) and identified 144 CpGs that provided substantial discrimination (area under the curve=0.90-0.99) for current heavy alcohol intake (⩾42 g per day in men and ⩾28 g per day in women) in four replication cohorts. The ancestry-stratified meta-analysis in whole blood identified 328 (9643 European ancestry samples) and 165 (2423 African ancestry samples) alcohol-related CpGs at Bonferroni-adjusted P<1 × 10(-7). Analysis of the monocyte-derived DNA (n=1251) identified 62 alcohol-related CpGs at P<1 × 10(-7). In whole-blood samples of people of European ancestry, we detected differential methylation in two neurotransmitter receptor genes, the γ-Aminobutyric acid-A receptor delta and γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor subunit 1; their differential methylation was associated with expression levels of a number of genes involved in immune function. In conclusion, we have identified a robust alcohol-related DNA methylation signature and shown the potential utility of DNA methylation as a clinically useful diagnostic test to detect current heavy alcohol consumption.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,alcohol,Meta-analysis",10.1038/mp.2016.192,"Adult;Aged;Alcohol Drinking/*genetics/metabolism;Alcohol-Related Disorders/*genetics/metabolism;Biomarkers/blood;Black People/genetics;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation/*drug effects;Epigenesis, Genetic;Ethanol/blood/metabolism;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;White People/genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Alcohol Drinking;Alcoholics;Methylation;DNA, A-Form;DNA, B-Form;DNA",27843151,PMC5575985

The potential pathway underlying above association, especially the role of DNA methylation is unclear. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the associations of personal PM(2.5) concentrations with DNA methylation at the epigenome-wide level, and investigate how PM(2.5)-related DNA methylation affects lung function. A total of 402 observations of non-smokers were selected from the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort. PM(2.5) exposure was estimated through a model established in the same population. Blood DNA methylation levels were determined through Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips. Lung function was tested through spirometry on the day of blood sampling. The associations of PM(2.5) exposure with DNA methylation and DNA methylation with lung function were determined through linear mixed models. Ten PM(2.5)-related CpG sites (mapped to 7 different genes) were observed with false discovery rate <0.05. Methylation levels of cg24821877, cg24862131, cg23530876, cg11149743 and cg10781276 were positively associated with PM(2.5) concentrations.

To better understand the full spectrum of health consequences, biomarkers that accurately classify cannabis use are needed. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an excellent candidate, yet no blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in humans exist. We conducted an EWAS of lifetime cannabis use (ever vs. never) using blood-based DNAm data from a case-cohort study within Sister Study, a prospective cohort of women at risk of developing breast cancer (Discovery N = 1,730 [855 ever users]; Replication N = 853 [392 ever users]). We identified and replicated an association with lifetime cannabis use at cg15973234 (CEMIP): combined p = 3.3 × 10(-8) . We found no overlap between published blood-based cis-meQTLs of cg15973234 and reported lifetime cannabis use-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs; p < .05), suggesting that the observed DNAm difference was driven by cannabis exposure. We also developed a multi-CpG classifier of lifetime cannabis use using penalized regression of top EWAS CpGs. The resulting 50-CpG classifier produced an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74 (95% CI [0.72, 0.76], p = 2.00 × 10(-5) ) in the discovery sample and AUC = 0.54 ([0.51, 0.57], p = 2.87 × 10(-2) ) in the replication sample.

We included 479 Australian women, including 132 twin pairs and 215 sisters of these twins. Blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Data on average ambient temperature during eight different exposure windows [lag0d (the blood draw day), lag0-7d (the current day and previous seven days prior to blood draw), lag0-14d, lag0-21d, lag0-28d, lag0-90d, lag0-180d, and lag0-365d)] was linked to each participant's home address.

We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We identified 31 CpGs at which blood DNA methylation were significantly associated with ambient temperature with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05. There were 82 significant DMRs identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Most of these CpGs and DMRs only showed association with temperature during one specific exposure window. These CpGs and DMRs were mapped to 85 genes. These related genes have been related to many human chronic diseases or phenotypes (e.g., diabetes, arthritis, breast cancer, depression, asthma, body height) in previous studies. The signals of short-term windows (lag0d and lag0-21d) showed enrichment in biological processes related to cell adhesion. In conclusion, short-, medium-, and long-term exposures to ambient temperature were all associated with blood DNA methylation, but the target genomic loci varied by exposure window.

To evaluate associations of long-term air pollution exposure with DNA methylation in blood, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study in a Korean chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort (N = 100 including 60 cases) using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip. Annual average concentrations of particulate matter ≤ 10 μm in diameter (PM(10)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) were estimated at participants' residential addresses using exposure prediction models. We used robust linear regression to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and two different approaches, DMRcate and comb-p, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). RESULTS: After multiple testing correction (false discovery rate < 0.05), there were 12 DMPs and 27 DMRs associated with PM(10) and 45 DMPs and 57 DMRs related to NO(2). DMP cg06992688 (OTUB2) and several DMRs were associated with both exposures. Eleven DMPs in relation to NO(2) confirmed previous findings in Europeans; the remainder were novel. Methylation levels of 39 DMPs were associated with expression levels of nearby genes in a separate dataset of 3075 individuals. Enriched networks were related to outcomes associated with air pollution including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as inflammatory and immune responses.

We evaluated the association between Phase 1 smoking status and rate of methylation change, using generalized estimating equation models. Among the 6958 CpG sites examined, smoking status was associated with methylation change for 22 CpGs (false discovery rate q < 0.1), with the majority (91%) becoming less methylated over time.

Significant enrichment was observed for CpG islands, enhancers, and DNAse hypersensitivity sites (p < 0.05). Although biological pathway analyses were not significant, most of the 22 CpGs were within genes known to be associated with cardiovascular disease, cancers, and aging.

A cross-sectional analysis of the association between smoking and DNA methylation and a longitudinal analysis of changes in smoking status and changes in DNA methylation were conducted. We used our cross-sectional analysis to replicate previously reported associations for current (N = 3,327) and former (N = 172) smoking. A comprehensive smoking index accounting for the biological half-life of smoking compounds and several aspects of smoking history was constructed to assess the reversibility of smoking-induced methylation changes.

DESIGN: The discovery cohort consisted of 4355 women from the WHI. The replication cohort consisted of 571 mono- and dizygotic twins from the TwinsUK cohort. DNA methylation was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. Diet quality was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010). A meta-analysis, stratified by study cohort, was performed using generalized linear models that regressed methylation on AHEI-2010, adjusting for cell composition, chip number and location, study characteristics, principal components of genetic relatedness, age, smoking status, race/ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). Statistical significance was defined as a false discovery rate < 0.05. Significant sites were tested for replication in the TwinsUK cohort, with significant replication defined by P < 0.05 and a consistent direction.

We investigated the relationships of methylation markers with both cotinine, an established marker of internal smoking exposure, and self-reported smoking. METHODS: Blood DNA methylation levels across the genome and serum cotinine were measured in 1000 older adults aged 50-75 years. Epigenome-wide scans were performed to identify methylation markers associated with cotinine. The inter-dose-response relationships between the number of cigarettes smoked per day, cotinine concentration, and DNA methylation were modeled by restricted cubic spline regression. RESULTS: Of 61 CpGs that passed the genome-wide significance threshold (p<1.13×10(-7)), 40 CpGs in 25 chromosomal regions were successfully replicated, showing 0.2-3% demethylation per 10ng/ml increases in cotinine. The strongest associations were observed for several loci at AHRR, F2RL3, 2q37.1, 6p21.33, and GFI1 that were previously identified to be related to self-reported smoking. One locus at RAB34 was newly discovered. Both cotinine and methylation markers exhibited non-linear relationships with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, where the highest rates of increase in cotinine and decreases in methylation were observed at low smoking intensity (1-15 cigarettes/day) and plateaued at high smoking intensity (>15-20 cigarettes/day). A clear linear relationship was observed between cotinine concentration and methylation level. Both cotinine and methylation markers showed similar accuracy in distinguishing current from never smoker, but only methylation markers distinguished former from never smoker with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study corroborates and expands the list of smoking-associated DNA methylation markers. Methylation levels were linearly related to cotinine concentration and provided accurate measures for both current and past smoking exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,smoking",10.1016/j.envres.2016.01.026,Aged;Biomarkers/blood;Cohort Studies;Cotinine/*blood;DNA/*blood;*DNA Methylation;Female;Germany/epidemiology;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Self Report;Smoking/*epidemiology;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke,26826776,

An increasingly recognised need for large-scale, longitudinally-profiled samples collected world-wide has made the development of efficient and straightforward sample collection and storage procedures a pressing issue. An alternative to the low-temperature storage of EDTA tubes of venous blood samples, which are frequently the source of the DNA used in such studies, is to collect and store at room temperature blood samples using purpose built filter paper, such as Whatman FTA® cards. Our goal was to determine whether DNA stored in this manner can be used to generate DNA methylation profiles comparable to those generated using blood samples frozen in EDTA tubes. Methods: DNA methylation profiles were obtained from matched EDTA tube and Whatman FTA® card whole-blood samples from 62 Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study participants using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Multiple quality control procedures were implemented, the relationship between the two sample types assessed, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) performed for smoking status, age and the interaction between these variables and sample storage method. Results: Dried blood spot (DBS) DNA methylation profiles were of good quality and DNA methylation profiles from matched DBS and EDTA tube samples were highly correlated (mean r = 0.991) and could distinguish between participants. EWASs replicated established associations for smoking and age, with no evidence for moderation by storage method. Conclusions: Our results support the use of Whatman FTA® cards for collecting and storing blood samples for DNA methylation profiling. This approach is likely to be particularly beneficial for large-scale studies and those carried out in areas where freezer access is limited. Furthermore, our results will inform consideration of the use of newborn heel prick DBSs for research use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15136.1,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,30984878,PMC6446498

Epigenetic alterations may functionally link EDCs with gene expression and metabolic traits. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate metabolic-related effects of the exposure to endocrine disruptors including five parabens, three bisphenols, and 13 metabolites of nine phthalates as measured in 24-hour urine on epigenome-wide DNA methylation. METHODS: A blood-based epigenome-wide association study was performed in 622 participants from the Lifelines DEEP cohort using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 methylation data and EDC excretions in 24-hour urine. Out of the 21 EDCs, 13 compounds were detected in >75% of the samples and, together with bisphenol F, were included in these analyses.

DNA methylation (DNAm) may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Toenail metals are non-invasive biomarkers, reflecting a medium-term time exposure window. OBJECTIVES: This study examined variation in leukocyte DNAm and toenail arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), and mercury (Hg) among elderly men in the Normative Aging Study, a longitudinal cohort. METHODS: We repeatedly collected samples of blood and toenail clippings. We measured DNAm in leukocytes with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 K BeadChip. We first performed median regression to evaluate the effects of each individual toenail metal on DNAm at three levels: individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, regions, and pathways. Then, we applied a Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to assess the joint and individual effects of metal mixtures on DNAm. Significant CpGs were identified using a multiple testing correction based on the independent degrees of freedom approach for correlated outcomes. The approach considers the effective degrees of freedom in the DNAm data using the principal components that explain >95% variation of the data. RESULTS: We included 564 subjects (754 visits) between 1999 and 2013. The numbers of significantly differentially methylated CpG sites, regions, and pathways varied by metals. For example, we found six significant pathways for As, three for Cd, and one for Mn. The As-associated pathways were associated with cancer (e.g., skin cancer) and cardiovascular disease, whereas the Cd-associated pathways were related to lung cancer. Metal mixtures were also associated with 47 significant CpG sites, as well as pathways, mainly related to cancer and cardiovascular disease.

METHODS: We conducted a methylome-wide association study among twelve cohort- and race/ethnicity-stratified subpopulations from the Women's Health Initiative and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 8397; mean age: 61.5 years; 83% female; 45% African American; 9% Hispanic/Latino American). We averaged geocoded address-specific estimates of daily and monthly mean PM concentrations over 2, 7, 28, and 365 days and 1 and 12 months before exams at which we measured leukocyte DNAm in whole blood. We estimated subpopulation-specific, DNAm-PM associations at approximately 485,000 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites in multi-level, linear, mixed-effects models. We combined subpopulation- and site-specific estimates in fixed-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses, then for associations that exceeded methylome-wide significance and were not heterogeneous across subpopulations (P < 1.0 × 10(-7); P(Cochran's Q) > 0.10), we characterized associations using publicly accessible genomic databases and attempted replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study. RESULTS: Analyses identified significant DNAm-PM associations at three CpG sites. Twenty-eight-day mean PM(10) was positively associated with DNAm at cg19004594 (chromosome 20; MATN4; P = 3.33 × 10(-8)). One-month mean PM(10) and PM(2.5-10) were positively associated with DNAm at cg24102420 (chromosome 10; ARPP21; P = 5.84 × 10(-8)) and inversely associated with DNAm at cg12124767 (chromosome 7; CFTR; P = 9.86 × 10(-8)). The PM-sensitive CpG sites mapped to neurological, pulmonary, endocrine, and cardiovascular disease-related genes, but DNAm at those sites was not associated with gene expression in blood cells and did not replicate in KORA. CONCLUSIONS: Ambient PM concentrations were associated with DNAm at genomic regions potentially related to poor health among racially, ethnically and environmentally diverse populations of U.S. women and men.

We aimed to evaluate the associations between long-term exposure to wildfire-related PM(2.5) and blood DNA methylation, and whether the associations differ from those with non-wildfire-related PM(2.5). METHODS: We studied 479 Australian women comprising 132 twin pairs and 215 of their sisters. Blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Data on 3-year (year of blood collection and previous two years) average wildfire-related and non-wildfire-related PM(2.5) at 0.01°×0.01° spatial resolution were created by combining information from satellite observations, chemical transport models, and ground-based observations. Exposure data were linked to each participant's home address, assuming the address did not change during the exposure window. For DNA methylation of each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), and for global DNA methylation represented by the average of all measured CpGs or CpGs in repetitive elements, we evaluated their associations with wildfire- or non-wildfire-related PM(2.5) using a within-sibship analysis controlling for factors shared between siblings and other important covariates. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined by comb-p and DMRcate. RESULTS: The 3-year average wildfire-related PM(2.5) (range: 0.3 to 7.6 µg/m(3)(,) mean: 1.6 µg/m(3)) was negatively, but not significantly (p-values greater than 0.05) associated with all seven global DNA methylation measures. There were 26 CpGs and 33 DMRs associated with wildfire-related PM(2.5) (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05) mapped to 47 genes enriched for pathways related to inflammatory regulation and platelet activation. These genes have been related to many human diseases or phenotypes e.g., cancer, mental disorders, diabetes, obesity, asthma, blood pressure. These CpGs, DMRs and enriched pathways did not overlap with the 1 CpG and 7 DMRs associated with non-wildfire-related PM(2.5).

Epigenomic analyses have been limited and mainly focused on occupational chromium exposure; their findings are not generalizable to populations with environmental Cr exposure. Methods: We identified the differential methylation of genes and regions to elucidate the mechanisms of toxicity related to environmental chromium exposure. DNA methylation was measured in blood samples collected from individuals in Cr-contaminated (n = 10) and unexposed areas (n = 10) by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation850K array. To evaluate the relationship between chromium levels in urine and CpG methylation at 850 thousand sites, we investigated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by using linear models and DMRcate method, respectively. The model was adjusted for biologically relevant variables and estimated cell-type compositions. Results: At the epigenome-wide level, we identified five CpGs [cg20690919 (p (FDR =)0.006), cg00704664 (p (FDR =)0.024), cg10809143 (p (FDR =)0.043), cg27057652 (p (FDR =)0.047), cg05390480 (p (FDR =)0.024)] and one DMR (chr17: 19,648,718-19,648,972), annotated to ALDH3A1 genes (p < 0.05) as being significantly associated with log(2) transformed urinary chromium levels.

METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on 611 adults free of diagnosed disease, living in Italy and Sweden, in whom we also measured plasma concentrations of 6 PCB congeners, DDE and hexachlorobenzene. RESULTS: We identified 650 CpG sites whose methylation correlates strongly (FDR < 0.01) with plasma concentrations of at least one PCB congener. Stronger effects were observed in males and in Sweden. This epigenetic exposure profile shows extensive and highly statistically significant overlaps with published profiles associated with the risk of future B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as with clinical CLL (38 and 28 CpG sites, respectively). For all these sites, the methylation changes were in the same direction for increasing exposure and for higher disease risk or clinical disease status, suggesting an etiological link between exposure and CLL. Mediation analysis reinforced the suggestion of a causal link between exposure, changes in DNA methylation and disease. Disease connectivity analysis identified multiple additional diseases associated with differentially methylated genes, including melanoma for which an etiological link with PCB exposure is established, as well as developmental and neurological diseases for which there is corresponding epidemiological evidence. Differentially methylated genes include many homeobox genes, suggesting that PCBs target stem cells. Furthermore, numerous polycomb protein target genes were hypermethylated with increasing exposure, an effect known to constitute an early marker of carcinogenesis.

Methylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sequences in the DNA was assessed from blood samples collected at age 18 years (n = 369) in the F1 generation. We conducted an epigenome wide association study to examine CpGs related to the frequency of heavy vehicles passing by subjects' homes, and employed multiple linear regression models to assess potential associations. We repeated some of these analysis in the F2 generation (n = 140). Thirty-five CpG sites were associated with heavy vehicular traffic. After adjusting for confounders, we found 23 CpGs that were more methylated, and 11 CpGs that were less methylated with increasing heavy vehicular traffic frequency among all subjects. In the F2 generation, 2 of 31 CpGs were associated with traffic frequencies and the direction of the effect was the same as in the F1 subset while differential methylation of 7 of 31 CpG sites correlated with gene expression.

We examined the association between alcohol consumption and DNA methylation patterns using 3 approaches: a conventional epigenome-wide association study (EWAS); a co-twin comparison design, which controls for genetic and environmental influences that twins share; and a regression of age acceleration, defined as a discrepancy between chronological age and DNA methylation age, on alcohol consumption. METHODS: Participants came from the Finnish Twin Cohorts (FinnTwin12/FinnTwin16; N = 1,004; 55% female; average age = 23 years). Individuals reported the number of alcoholic beverages consumed in the past week, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. RESULTS: In the EWAS, alcohol consumption was significantly related to methylation at 24 CpG sites. When evaluating whether differences between twin siblings (185 monozygotic pairs) in alcohol consumption predicted differences in DNA methylation, co-twin comparisons replicated 4 CpG sites from the EWAS and identified 23 additional sites. However, when we examined qualitative differences in drinking patterns between twins (heavy drinker vs. light drinker/abstainer or moderate drinker vs. abstainer; 44 pairs), methylation patterns did not significantly differ within twin pairs. Finally, individuals who reported higher alcohol consumption also exhibited greater age acceleration, though results were no longer significant after controlling for genetic and environmental influences shared by co-twins.

However, there is limited research on the underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the pathophysiology and a possible causal pathway from treatment exposures to cardiometabolic conditions, we conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify the DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with cancer treatment exposures and examined whether treatment-associated DNAm sites mediate associations between specific treatments and cardiometabolic conditions. METHODS: We included 2052 survivors (median age 33.7 years) of European ancestry from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation were abstracted from medical records. Seven cardiometabolic conditions were clinically assessed. DNAm profile was measured using MethylationEPIC BeadChip with blood-derived DNA. RESULTS: By performing multiple treatment-specific EWAS, we identified 935 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites mapped to 538 genes/regions associated with one or more cancer treatments at the epigenome-wide significance level (p < 9 × 10(-8)). Among the treatment-associated CpGs, 8 were associated with obesity, 63 with hypercholesterolemia, and 17 with hypertriglyceridemia (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05). We observed substantial mediation by methylation at four independent CpGs (cg06963130, cg21922478, cg22976567, cg07403981) for the association between abdominal field radiotherapy (abdominal-RT) and risk of hypercholesterolemia (70.3%) and by methylation at three CpGs (cg19634849, cg13552692, cg09853238) for the association between abdominal-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (54.6%). In addition, three CpGs (cg26572901, cg12715065, cg21163477) partially mediated the association between brain-RT and obesity with a 32.9% mediation effect, and two CpGs mediated the association between corticosteroids and obesity (cg22351187, 14.2%) and between brain-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (cg13360224, 10.5%). Notably, several mediator CpGs reside in the proximity of well-established dyslipidemia genes: cg21922478 (ITGA1) and cg22976567 (LMNA). CONCLUSIONS: In childhood cancer survivors, cancer treatment exposures are associated with DNAm patterns present decades following the exposure. Treatment-associated DNAm sites may mediate the causal pathway from specific treatment exposures to certain cardiometabolic conditions, suggesting the utility of DNAm sites as risk predictors and potential mechanistic targets for future intervention studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cancer treatment",10.1186/s13073-021-00875-1,*Cancer Survivors;*Cardiometabolic Risk Factors;Cohort Studies;DNA Methylation/*genetics;Female;Humans;Male;Treatment Outcome;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Survivors;Methylation,33823916,PMC8025387

Pb exposure influences the epigenome with documented effects on DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the impact of low levels of Pb exposure on DNAm among non-miner individuals from two locations in Peru: Lima, the capital, and Cerro de Pasco, a highland mining town, to study the effects of Pb exposure on physiological outcomes and DNAm. METHODS: Pb levels were measured in whole blood (n = 305). Blood leukocyte DNAm was determined for 90 DNA samples using the Illumina MethylationEPIC chip. An epigenome-wide association study was performed to assess the relationship between Pb and DNAm. RESULTS: Individuals from Cerro de Pasco had higher Pb than individuals from Lima (p-value = 2.00E-16). Males had higher Pb than females (p-value = 2.36E-04). Pb was positively associated with hemoglobin (p-value = 8.60E-04). In Cerro de Pasco, blood Pb decreased with the distance from the mine (p-value = 0.04), and association with soil Pb was approaching significance (p-value = 0.08).

We also found 45 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), seven of which were associated with genes involved in metal ion binding and nine to neurological function and development. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that even low levels of Pb can have a significant impact on the body including changes to DNAm.

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages.

However, EWAS of PM(2.5) elements (PEs), reflecting different emission sources, are very limited. OBJECTIVES: We performed EWAS of short- and intermediate-term exposure to PM(2.5) and 13 PEs. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNAm may vary by PM(2.5) mass and its elements. METHODS: We repeatedly collected blood samples in the Normative Aging Study and measured leukocyte DNA methylation (DNAm) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. We collected daily PM(2.5) and 13 PEs at a fixed central site. To estimate the associations between each PE and DNAm at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, we incorporated a distributed-lag (0-27 d) term in the setting of median regression with subject-specific intercept and examined cumulative lag associations. We also accounted for selection bias due to loss to follow-up and mortality prior to enrollment. Significantly differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We further conducted regional and pathway analyses to identify significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and pathways. RESULTS: We included 695 men with 1,266 visits between 1999 and 2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75 years. The significant DMPs, DMRs, and pathways varied by to PM(2.5) total mass and PEs. For example, PM(2.5) total mass was associated with 2,717 DMPs and 10,470 DMRs whereas Pb was associated with 3,173 DMPs and 637 DMRs. The identified pathways by PM(2.5) mass were mostly involved in mood disorders, neuroplasticity, immunity, and inflammation, whereas the pathways associated with motor vehicles (BC, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were related with cardiovascular disease and cancer (e.g., ""PPARs signaling"").

We found that TCE exposure increased methylation variation globally (Kruskal-Wallis p-value = 3.75e-3) and in 25 CpG sites at a genome-wide significance level (Bonferroni p-value < 0.05). We identified a 609 basepair region in the TRIM68 gene promoter that exhibited hypomethylation with increased exposure to TCE (FWER = 1.20e-2). Also, genes that matched to differentially variable CpGs were enriched in the 'focal adhesion' biological pathway (p-value = 2.80e-2). All in all, human exposure to TCE was associated with epigenetic alterations in genes involved in cell-matrix adhesions and interferon subtype expression, which are important in the development of autoimmune diseases; and in genes related to cancer development. These results suggest that DNA methylation may play a role in the pathogenesis of TCE exposure-related diseases and that TCE exposure may contribute to epigenetic drift.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: TCE exposure",10.1080/15592294.2019.1633866,Adult;Autoantigens/genetics;Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;Female;Genetic Loci;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;*Genetic Variation;Humans;Male;Neoplasms/*genetics;Trichloroethylene/*pharmacology;Tripartite Motif Proteins/genetics;Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics;Humanities;Humanism;Trichloroethylene;Autoimmune Diseases;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,31241004,PMC6773405

This study considered the association between problematic adolescent cannabis use and methylation. METHOD: Using an enrichment-based sequencing approach, a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed of problematic adolescent cannabis use in 703 adolescent samples from the Great Smoky Mountain Study. Using epigenomic deconvolution, MWASs were performed for the main cell types in blood: granulocytes, T cells, B cells, and monocytes. Enrichment testing was conducted to establish overlap between cannabis-associated methylation differences and variants associated with negative mental health effects of adolescent cannabis use. RESULTS: Whole-blood analyses identified 45 significant CpGs, and cell type-specific analyses yielded 32 additional CpGs not identified in the whole-blood MWAS. Significant overlap was observed between the B-cell MWAS and genetic studies of education attainment and intelligence. Furthermore, the results from both T cells and monocytes overlapped with findings from an MWAS of psychosis conducted in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: In one of the first methylome-wide association studies of adolescent cannabis use, several methylation sites located in genes of importance for potentially relevant brain functions were identified. These findings resulted in several testable hypotheses by which cannabis-associated methylation can impact neurological development and inflammation response as well as potential mechanisms linking cannabis-associated methylation to potential downstream mental health effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cannabis",10.1016/j.jaac.2021.02.008,Adolescent;*Cannabis;DNA Methylation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Mental Health;*Psychotic Disorders;Cannabis,33631312,PMC8380262

Arsenic is associated with a number of health outcomes, with epigenetic modification suggested as a potential mechanism of toxicity. OBJECTIVE: Among a sample of 400 adult participants, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, as measured by blood and urinary total arsenic concentrations, and epigenome-wide white blood cell DNA methylation. METHODS: We used linear regression models to examine the associations between arsenic exposure and methylation at each CpG site, adjusted for sex, age, and batch. Differentially methylated loci were subsequently examined in relation to corresponding gene expression for functional evidence of gene regulation. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we observed four differentially methylated CpG sites with urinary total arsenic concentration and three differentially methylated CpG sites with blood arsenic concentration, based on the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p < 1 × 10(-7). Methylation of PLA2G2C (probe cg04605617) was the most significantly associated locus in relation to both urinary (p = 3.40 × 10(-11)) and blood arsenic concentrations (p = 1.48 × 10(-11)). Three additional novel methylation loci-SQSTM1 (cg01225779), SLC4A4 (cg06121226), and IGH (cg13651690)--were also significantly associated with arsenic exposure. Further, there was evidence of methylation-related gene regulation based on gene expression for a subset of differentially methylated loci. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant associations between arsenic exposure and gene-specific differential white blood cell DNA methylation, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may be an important pathway underlying arsenic toxicity.

Moreover, we validated two previously reported CpG sites (cg05886626 in THBS1, and cg24838345 in MTSS1) for their potential relation to atherosclerosis and cancer diseases, using several different approaches: CpG site methylation, gene expression, and plasma protein level determinations. Smoking was also associated with higher THBS1 gene expression but with lower levels of thrombospondin-1 in plasma.

O BJECTIVES : We studied the association of Cd and smoking exposures with human blood DNA methylation (DNAm) pro fi les. We also evaluated the implication of fi ndings to relevant methylation pathways and the potential contribution of Cd exposure from smoking to explain the association between smoking and site -speci fi c DNAm. M ETHODS : We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of urine Cd and self -reported smoking (current and former vs. never, and cumulative smoking dose) with blood DNAm in 790,026 CpGs (methylation sites) measured with the Illumina In fi nium Human MethylationEPIC (Illumina Inc.) platform in 2,325 adults 45 - 74 years of age who participated in the Strong Heart Study in 1989 - 1991. In a mediation analysis, we estimated the amount of change in DNAm associated with smoking that can be independently attributed to increases in urine Cd concentrations from smoking. We also conducted enrichment analyses and in silico protein - protein interaction networks to explore the biological relevance of the fi ndings. R ESULTS : At a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected level of 0.05, we found 6 di ff erentially methylated positions (DMPs) for Cd; 288 and 17, respec- tively, for current and former smoking status; and 77 for cigarette pack -years. Enrichment analyses of these DMPs displayed enrichment of 58 and 6 Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene sets, respectively, including biological pathways for cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Among DMPs that were signi fi cant for both Cd and current smoking (annotated to PRSS23, AHRR, F2RL3, RARA, and 2q37.1), we found statistically signi fi cant contributions of Cd to smoking -related DNAm. C ONCLUSIONS : Beyond replicating well-known smoking epigenetic signatures, we found novel DMPs related to smoking.

The World Trade Center (WTC) responders sustained exposures to potential carcinogens, resulting in an increased risk of cancer. Previous studies of cancer risk in WTC-exposed responders were limited by the deficiency in quantitative and individual information on exposure to carcinogens. The current study introduces a new exposure-ranking index (ERI) for estimating cancer-related acute and chronic exposures, which aimed to improve the ability of future analyses to estimate cancer risk. An epigenome-wide association study based on DNA methylation and a weighted gene co-expression network analysis were carried out to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) sites, modules of correlated CpG sites, and biological pathways associated with the new ERI. Methylation was profiled on blood samples using Illumina 450K Beadchip. No significant epigenome-wide association was found for ERI at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Several cancer-related pathways emerged in pathway analyses for the top ranking genes from epigenome-wide association study as well as enriched module from the weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The current study was the first DNA methylation study that aimed to identify methylation signature for cancer-related exposure in the WTC population. No CpG sites survived multiple testings adjustment. However, enriched gene sets involved in cancer, were identified in both acute and chronic ERIs, supporting the view that multiple genes play a role in this complex exposure.

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs), mostly in non-Asian populations, have been conducted to identify smoking-associated methylation alterations at individual probes. There are few data on regional methylation changes in relation to smoking. Few data link differential methylation in blood to differential gene expression in lung tissue.        Results: We identified 108 significant (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and 87 significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (multiple-testing corrected p < 0.01) in current compared to never smokers from our EWAS of cotinine-validated smoking in blood DNA from a Korean chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort (n = 100 including 31 current, 30 former, and 39 never smokers) using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.

Methylation correlated with urine cotinine levels in current smokers at six DMPs, with pack-years in current smokers at six DMPs, and with duration of smoking cessation in former smokers at eight DMPs. Of the 143 genes to which our significant DMPs or DMRs annotated, gene expression levels at 20 genes were associated with pack-years in lung tissue transcriptome data of smokers (Asan Biobank, n = 188).        Conclusions: Our study of differential methylation in Koreans confirmed previous findings from non-Asian populations and revealed novel loci in relation to smoking.

The significance threshold was set at 0.05 for false-discovery rate-adjusted p values per food group. Results We identified significant associations between the methylation level of CpG sites and the consumption of onions and garlic (2), nuts and seeds (18), milk (1), cream (11), plant oils (4), butter (13), and alcoholic beverages (27). The signals targeted genes of metabolic health relevance, for example, GLI1, RPTOR, and DIO1, among others. Conclusion This EWAS is unique with its focus on food groups that are part of a Western diet. Significant findings were mostly related to food groups with a high-fat content.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Diet",10.1007/s00394-022-03074-9     EA DEC 2022,DNA METHYLATION;NONAGENARIAN SIBLINGS;RISK;DIET;IDENTIFICATION;VITAMIN-B-12;FOLATE;BLOOD,,

CALERIE (TM) randomized 220 healthy, nonobese adults in a 2:1 allocation to 2 years of CR or ad libitum (AL) diet. The average CR in the treatment group through 24 months of follow-up was 12%.

Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis tested CR-induced changes from baseline to 12 and 24 months in the n = 197 participants with available DNAm data. CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p < .003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age-associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p < .003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin production, glucose tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and DNA-regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR.

We examined the association between epigenome-wide DNA methylation and serum cotinine levels as a proxy of nicotine exposure and smoking quantity, assessed the role of SNPs in these associations, and evaluated molecular mediation by methylation in a sample of biochemically verified current smokers (N=310).ResultsDNA methylation at 50 CpG sites was associated (FDR <0.05) with cotinine levels, 17 of which are novel associations. As cotinine levels are influenced not only by nicotine intake but also by CYP2A6-mediated nicotine metabolism rate, we performed secondary analyses adjusting for genetic risk score of nicotine metabolism rate and identified five additional novel associations. We further assessed the potential role of genetic variants in the detected association between methylation and cotinine levels observing 124 cis and 3898 trans methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs). Nineteen of these SNPs were also associated with cotinine levels (FDR <0.05). Further, at seven CpG sites, we observed a trend (P<0.05) that altered DNA methylation mediates the effect of SNPs on nicotine exposure rather than a direct consequence of smoking. Finally, we performed replication of our findings in two independent cohorts of biochemically verified smokers (N=450 and N=79).ConclusionsUsing cotinine, a biomarker of nicotine exposure, we replicated and extended identification of novel epigenetic associations in smoking-related genes. We also demonstrated that DNA methylation in some of the identified loci is driven by the underlying genotype and may mediate the causal effect of genotype on cotinine levels.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1186/s13148-018-0606-9,NICOTINE METABOLITE RATIO;DIFFERENTIAL DNA METHYLATION;SELF-REPORTED        SMOKING;CIGARETTE SMOKERS;BLOOD;BIOMARKER;PATHWAY;LUNG;CESSATION;ACCURACY;Epigenomics,,

Genetic and epigenetic markers are associated with isocyanate-induced asthma and, before asthma develops, we have shown that genetic polymorphisms are associated with variation in plasma and urine biomarker levels in exposed workers. Inter-individual epigenetic variance may also have a significant role in the observed biomarker variability following isocyanate exposure. Therefore, we determined the percent methylation for CpG islands from DNA extracted from mononuclear blood cells of 24 male spray-painters exposed to 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) monomer and HDI isocyanurate. Spray-painters' personal inhalation and skin exposure to these compounds and the respective biomarker levels of 1,6-diaminohexane (HDA) and trisaminohexyl isocyanurate (TAHI) in their plasma and urine were measured during three repeated industrial hygiene monitoring visits. We controlled for inhalation exposure, skin exposure, age, smoking status, and ethnicity as covariates and performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using likelihood-ratio statistical modeling. We identified 38 CpG markers associated with differences in isocyanate biomarker levels (Bonferroni < 0.05). Annotations for these markers included 18 genes: ALG1, ANKRD11, C16orf89, CHD7, COL27A, FUZ, FZD9, HMGN1, KRT6A, LEPR, MAPK10, MED25, NOSIP, PKD1, SNX19, UNC13A, UROS, and ZFHX3. We explored the functions of the genes that have been published in the literature and used GeneMANIA to investigate gene ontologies and predicted protein-interaction networks. The protein functions of the predicted networks include keratinocyte migration, cell-cell adhesions, calcium transport, neurotransmitter release, nitric oxide production, and apoptosis regulation. Many of the protein pathway functions overlap with previous findings on genetic markers associated with variability both in isocyanate biomarker levels and asthma susceptibility, which suggests there are overlapping protein pathways that contribute to both isocyanate toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. These predicted protein networks can inform future research on the mechanism of allergic airway sensitization by isocyanates and aid in the development of mitigation strategies to better protect worker health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HDI exposure",10.3389/fgene.2021.700636,EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE;DIISOCYANATE-INDUCED ASTHMA;GENETIC-VARIANTS;OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA;CLASS-I;INFLAMMATION;WORKERS;DNA;GENOTYPES;SYNTHASE;Biological Markers;Epigenomics,,

However, associations between intake of these nutrients and genome-wide DNA methylation levels have not been studied comprehensively in humans.        Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether folate and/or vitamin B-12 intake are asssociated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in leukocytes.        Methods: A large-scale epigenome-wide association study of folate and vitamin B-12 intake was performed on DNA from 5841 participants from 10 cohorts using Illumina 450k arrays. Folate and vitamin B-12 intakes were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Continuous and categorical (low compared with high intake) linear regression mixed models were applied per cohort, controlling for confounders. A meta-analysis was performed to identify significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs), and a pathway analysis was performed on the DMR annotated genes.        Results: The categorical model resulted in 6 DMPs, which are all negatively associated with folate intake, annotated to FAM64A, WRAP73, FRMD8, CUX1, and LCN8 genes, which have a role in cellular processes including centrosome localization, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Regional analysis showed 74 folate-associated DMRs, of which 73 were negatively associated with folate intake. The most significant folate-associated DMR was a 400-base pair (bp) spanning region annotated to the LGALS3BP gene. In the categorical model, vitamin B-12 intake was associated with 29 DMRs annotated to 48 genes, of which the most significant was a 1100-bp spanning region annotated to the calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated gene (CABYR). Vitamin B-12 intake was not associated with DMPs.        Conclusions: We identified novel epigenetic loci that are associated with folate and vitamin B-12 intake. Interestingly, we found a negative association between folate and DNA methylation.

The underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of AUD are largely unknown; however, growing evidence suggests that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with alterations in DNA methylation. Identification of alcohol-associated methylomic variation might provide novel insights into pathophysiology and novel treatment targets for AUD. Here we performed the largest single-cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption to date (N = 8161) and cross-validated findings in AUD populations with relevant endophenotypes, as well as alcohol-related animal models. Results showed 2504 CpGs significantly associated with alcohol consumption (Bonferroni p value < 6.8 x 10(-8)) with the five leading probes located in SLC7A11 (p = 7.75 x 10(-108)), JDP2 (p = 1.44 x 10(-56)), GAS5 (p = 2.71 x 10(-47)), TRA2B (p = 3.54 x 10(-42)), and SLC43A1 (p = 1.18 x 10(-40)). Genes annotated to associated CpG sites are implicated in liver and brain function, the cellular response to alcohol and alcohol-associated diseases, including hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Two-sample Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship of consumption on AUD risk (inverse variance weighted (IVW) p = 5.37 x 10(-09)). A methylation-based predictor of alcohol consumption was able to discriminate AUD cases in two independent cohorts (p = 6.32 x 10(-38) and p = 5.41 x 10(-14)). The top EWAS probe cg06690548, located in the cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11, was replicated in an independent cohort of AUD and control participants (N = 615) and showed strong hypomethylation in AUD (p < 10(-17)). Decreased CpG methylation at this probe was consistently associated with clinical measures including increased heavy drinking days (p < 10(-4)), increased liver function enzymes (GGT (p = 1.03 x 10(-21)), ALT (p = 1.29 x 10(-6)), and AST (p = 1.97 x 10(-8))) in individuals with AUD. Postmortem brain analyses documented increased SLC7A11 expression in the frontal cortex of individuals with AUD and animal models showed marked increased expression in liver, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol leads to hypomethylation-induced overexpression of SLC7A11. Taken together, our EWAS discovery sample and subsequent validation of the top probe in AUD suggest a strong role of abnormal glutamate signaling mediated by methylomic variation in SLC7A11. Our data are intriguing given the prominent role of glutamate signaling in brain and liver and might provide an important target for therapeutic intervention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: alcohol",10.1038/s41380-021-01378-6     EA DEC 2021,NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY;DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS;BLOOD-PRESSURE;MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION;DSM-IV;PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOL;WITHDRAWAL;REVEALS;RISK;METAANALYSIS;Alcoholics,,

Methods: We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants' blood in the Parkinson's Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California (N = 237). We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years (binary) with site-specific differential methylation, and used a false discovery rate (FDR) cut off of 0.05 for significance. We controlled for age, sex, education, cell count, and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity. We normalized methylation values for Type I/II probe bias using Beta-Mixture Quantile (BMIQ) normalization, filtered out cross-reactive probes, and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I/II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p-values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods, and controlling for cell count. To facilitate broader interpretation, we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis, using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw p < 0.05, and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip. We did this for both a biological process context (Gene Ontology terms) using missMethyl, and a disease set context using WebGestalt. For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets.        Results: After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization, 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures. When using GenomeStudio's Illumina normalization, 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated, including all four identified with the BMIQ method. In the gene set overrepresentation analyses, we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization, and 76 using Illumina normalization, including the 6 identified by BMIQ. For disease sets, we identified signals for Alzheimer's disease, leukemia and several other cancers, diabetes, birth defects, and other diseases, for both normalization methods. We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count, and controlling for cell count generally weakened p-values. BMIQ normalization, however, resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p-values.        Conclusions: Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research. However, this EWAS also implicates several novel diseases for future investigation, and highlights the relative importance of different background normalization methods in identifying associations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pesticide exposure",10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113569,DNA METHYLATION;AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES;RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY;URINARY        METABOLITES;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;CALCIUM-CHANNELS;AIR-POLLUTION;RISK;CHILDREN;GENE;Pesticides;California,,

Our results suggest that the dynamics of methylation changes following smoking cessation are driven by a differential and site-specific magnitude of the smoking-induced alterations (with persistent sites being most affected) irrespective of the intensity and duration of smoking. Analyses of the link between methylation and expression levels revealed that methylation predominantly and remotely down-regulates gene expression. Among genes whose expression was associated with our candidate CpG sites, LRRN3 appeared to be particularly interesting as it was one of the few genes whose methylation and expression were directly associated, and the only gene in which both methylation and gene expression were found associated with smoking. Our study highlights persistent epigenetic markers of smoking, which can potentially be detected decades after cessation. Such historical signatures are promising biomarkers to refine individual risk profiling of smoking-induced chronic disease such as lung cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1093/hmg/ddu751,HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;DIFFERENTIAL DNA METHYLATION;GENE-EXPRESSION;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;LUNG-CANCER;MATERNAL SMOKING;RISK;EPIDEMIOLOGY;ASSOCIATION;EXPOSURE;Smoke;Smoking Cessation;Smoking;Genome;Genomics;Methylation,,

Smoking can induce cellular and molecular changes, including epigenetic modification, but the short- and long-term epigenetic modifications caused by cigarette smoking at the gene level have not been well understood. Recent studies have identified smoking-related DNA methylation (DNAm) sites in Caucasians. To determine whether the same DNAm sites associate with smoking in African Americans, and to identify novel smoking-related DNAm sites, we conducted a methylome-wide association study of cigarette smoking using a discovery sample of 972 African Americans, and a replication sample of 239 African Americans with two array-based methods. Among 15 DNAm sites significantly associated with smoking after correction for multiple testing in our discovery sample, 5 DNAm sites are replicated in an independent cohort, and 14 sites in the replication sample have effects in the same direction as in the discovery sample. The top two smoking-related DNAm sites in F2RL3 (factor II receptor-like 3) and GPR15 (G-protein-coupled receptor 15) observed in African Americans are consistent with previous findings in Caucasians. The associations between the replicated DNAm sites and smoking remain significant after adjusting for genetic background. Despite the distinct genetic background between African Americans and Caucasians, the DNAm from the two ethnic groups shares common associations with cigarette smoking, which suggests a common molecular mechanism of epigenetic modification influenced by environmental exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1007/s00439-013-1311-6,"RISK-FACTORS;LIFE-STYLE;WOMEN;CANCER;BLOOD;HYPOMETHYLATION;EXPOSURE;HEAD;HYPOMETHYATION;EPIDEMIOLOGY;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",,

Here, we conducted single-site and differentially methylated region (DMR) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of these factors, in addition to similar to 3-year survival, using Illumina Methylation EPIC DNA methylation profiles from whole blood in 409 individuals as part of the Head and Neck 5000 (HN5000) study. Overlapping sites between each factor and survival were then assessed using two-step Mendelian randomization to assess whether methylation at these positions causally affected survival. Results Using the MethylationEPIC array in an OPC dataset, we found novel CpG associations with smoking, alcohol consumption and similar to 3-year survival. We found no CpG associations below our multiple testing threshold associated with HPV16 E6 serological response (used as a proxy for HPV infection). CpG site associations below our multiple-testing threshold (P-Bonferroni< 0.05) for both a prognostic factor and survival were observed at four gene regions:SPEG(smoking),GFI1(smoking),PPT2(smoking) andKHDC3L(alcohol consumption).

PCB exposure is also associated with alterations in epigenetic marks and gene transcription, which could lead to adverse health outcomes, but many of these are population-specific. To further investigate the association between PCB and epigenetic marks, DNA methylation was measured at 787,684 CpG sites in 641 peripheral blood samples from the Michigan Polybrominated Biphenyl (PBB) Registry. 1345 CpGs were associated with increased total PCB level after controlling for age, sex, and 24 surrogate variables (FDR < 0.05).

Recent technical advances in the genome-wide determination of single-base DNA-methylation enabled epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Early EWASs established robust associations between age and gender with the degree of CpG methylation at specific sites. Other studies uncovered associations with cigarette smoking. However, so far these studies were mainly conducted in Caucasians, raising the question of whether these findings can also be extrapolated to other populations.        Results: Here, we present an EWAS with age, gender, and smoking status in a family study of 123 individuals of Arab descent. We determined DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, applied state-of-the-art data processing protocols, including correction for blood cell type heterogeneity and hidden confounders, and eliminated probes containing SNPs at the targeted CpG site using 40x whole-genome sequencing data. Using this approach, we could replicate the leading published EWAS associations with age, gender and smoking, and recovered hallmarks of gender-specific epigenetic changes. Interestingly, we could even replicate the recently reported precise prediction of chronological age based on the methylation of only a few selected CpG sites.        Conclusion: Our study supports the view that when applied with state-of-the art protocols to account for all potential confounders, DNA methylation arrays represent powerful tools for EWAS with more complex phenotypes that can also be successfully applied to non-Caucasian populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1186/s13148-014-0040-6,EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;BLOOD;GENE;EPIGENETICS;DESIGN;DIET;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Arabs;Methylation,,

METHODS: We performed a genome-wide methylation study using robust linear regression models in 1,017 subjects from the LifeLines cohort study to analyze the association between exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5, fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m; PM10, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) and PM2.5absorbance, indicator of elemental carbon content (estimated with land use-regression models) with DNA methylation in whole blood (Illumina (R) HumanMethylation450K BeadChip).

Methods: We derived a nested case-control study from the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), including 140 incident patients who developed lung cancer during 2009-13 and 140 controls.

Because alcohol consumption has been previously linked to DNA methylation (DNAm), we aimed to select DNAm signatures in blood to predict HAD from two demographically and clinically distinct populations (N-total = 1,549). We first separately conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for phosphatidylethanol (PEth), an objective measure of alcohol consumption, and for self-reported alcohol consumption in Cohort 1.

In contrast, no CpG reached epigenome-wide significance on self-reported alcohol consumption. Using a machine learning approach, two CpG subsets from EWAS on PEth and on self-reported alcohol consumption from Cohort 1 were separately tested for the prediction of HAD in Cohort 2. We found that a subset of 143 CpGs selected from the EWAS on PEth showed an excellent prediction of HAD with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 89.4% in training set and 73.9% in validation set of Cohort 2. However, CpGs preselected from the EWAS on self-reported alcohol consumption showed a poor prediction of HAD with AUC 75.2% in training set and 57.6% in validation set.

We aimed to investigate the association and underlying causation between smoking and blood methylation.        Methods: The methylation profile of DNA from the peripheral blood, collected as dried blood spots stored on Guthrie cards, was measured for 479 Australian women including 66 monozygotic twin pairs, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of twins from 130 twin families using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip array. Linear regression was used to estimate associations between methylation at similar to 410,000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) and smoking status. A regression-based methodology for twins, Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding (ICE FALCON), was used to assess putative causation.        Results: At a 5% false discovery rate, 39 CpGs located at 27 loci, including previously reported AHRR, F2RL3, 2q37.1 and 6p21.33, were found to be differentially methylated across never, former and current smokers. For all 39 CpG sites, current smokers had the lowest methylation level. Our study provides the first replication for two previously reported CpG sites, cg06226150 (SLC2A4RG) and cg21733098 (12q24.32). From the ICE FALCON analysis with smoking status as the predictor and methylation score as the outcome, a woman's methylation score was associated with her co-twin's smoking status, and the association attenuated towards the null conditioning on her own smoking status, consistent with smoking status causing changes in methylation. To the contrary, using methylation score as the predictor and smoking status as the outcome, a woman's smoking status was not associated with her co-twin's methylation score, consistent with changes in methylation not causing smoking status.        Conclusions: For middle-aged women, peripheral blood DNA methylation at several genomic locations is associated with smoking. Our study suggests that smoking has a causal effect on peripheral blood DNA methylation, but not vice versa.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,smoking",10.1186/s13148-018-0452-9,HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY MEASURES;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;WIDE ASSOCIATION;BREAST-CANCER;LUNG-CANCER;LOCI;IDENTIFICATION;EPIGENETICS;DISCOVERY;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;Twins,,

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may contribute. Individual pesticides may be associated with specific DNA methylation patterns but no epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) has evaluated methylation in relation to individual pesticides.        OBJECTIVES: We conducted an EWAS of DNA methylation in relation to several pesticide active ingredients.        METHODS: The Agricultural Lung Health Study is a case-control study of asthma, nested within the Agricultural Health Study. We analyzed blood DNA methylation measured using Illumina's EPIC array in 1,170 male farmers of European ancestry. For pesticides still on the market at blood collection (2009-2013), we evaluated nine active ingredients for which at least 30 participants reported past and current (within the last 12 months) use, as well as seven banned organochlorines with at least 30 participants reporting past use. We used robust linear regression to compare methylation at individual C-phosphate-G sites (CpGs) among users of a specific pesticide to never users.        RESULTS: Using family-wise error rate (p < 9 x 10(-8)) or false-discovery rate (FDR <0:05), we identified 162 differentially methylated CpGs across 8 of 9 currently marketed active ingredients (acetochlor, atrazine, dicamba, glyphosate, malathion, metolachlor, mesotrione, and picloram) and one banned organochlorine (heptachlor). Differentially methylated CpGs were unique to each active ingredient, and a dose-response relationship with lifetime days of use was observed for most. Significant CpGs were enriched for transcription motifs and 28% of CpGs were associated with whole blood cis-gene expression, supporting functional effects of findings. We corroborated a previously reported association between dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (banned in the United States in 1972) and epigenetic age acceleration.        DISCUSSION: We identified differential methylation for several active ingredients in male farmers of European ancestry. These may serve as biomarkers of chronic exposure and could inform mechanisms of long-term health outcomes from pesticide exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pesticide exposure",10.1289/EHP8928,"EXPOSURE;ASSOCIATION;ATRAZINE;NEURONS;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Pesticides;Lung;Methylation;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA",,

Epigenetic dysregulation including changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), may be involved in arsenic toxicity. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of arsenic exposure have been restricted to single populations and comparison across EWAS has been limited by methodological differences. Leveraging data from epidemiological studies conducted in Chile and Bangladesh, we use a harmonized data processing and analysis pipeline and meta-analysis to combine results from four EWAS. Methods DNAm was measured among adults in Chile with and without prenatal and early-life As exposure in PBMCs and buccal cells (N = 40, 850K array) and among men in Bangladesh with high and low As exposure in PBMCs (N = 32, 850K array; N = 48, 450K array). Linear models were used to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially variable positions (DVPs) adjusting for age, smoking, cell type, and sex in the Chile cohort. Probes common across EWAS were meta-analyzed using METAL, and differentially methylated and variable regions (DMRs and DVRs, respectively) were identified using comb-p. KEGG pathway analysis was used to understand biological functions of DMPs and DVPs. Results In a meta-analysis restricted to PBMCs, we identified one DMP and 23 DVPs associated with arsenic exposure; including buccal cells, we identified 3 DMPs and 19 DVPs (FDR < 0.05). Using meta-analyzed results, we identified 11 DMRs and 11 DVRs in PBMC samples, and 16 DMRs and 19 DVRs in PBMC and buccal cell samples. One region annotated to LRRC27 was identified as a DMR and DVR. Arsenic-associated KEGG pathways included lysosome, autophagy, and mTOR signaling, AMPK signaling, and one carbon pool by folate. Conclusions Using a two-step process of (1) harmonized data processing and analysis and (2) meta-analysis, we leverage four DNAm datasets from two continents of individuals exposed to high levels of As prenatally and during adulthood to identify DMPs and DVPs associated with arsenic exposure. Our approach suggests that standardizing analytical pipelines can aid in identifying biological meaningful signals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Meta-analysis,arsenic exposure",10.1186/s12940-021-00754-7,DRINKING-WATER;GENE-EXPRESSION;CORD BLOOD;NORTHERN CHILE;IN-UTERO;ASSOCIATIONS;PACKAGE;MORTALITY;DISCOVERY;PLACENTA;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,,

While cigarette smoking is the primary cause of this malignancy, risk differs across racial/ethnic groups. For the same number of cigarettes smoked, Native Hawaiians compared to whites are at greater risk and Japanese Americans are at lower risk of developing lung cancer. DNA methylation of specific CpG sites (e.g., in AHRR and F2RL3) is the most common blood epigenetic modification associated with smoking status. However, the influence of internal smoking dose, measured by urinary nicotine equivalents (NE), on DNA methylation in current smokers has not been investigated, nor has a study evaluated whether for the same smoking dose, circulating leukocyte DNA methylation patterns differ by race.        Methods: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of NE in 612 smokers from three racial/ethnic groups: whites (n = 204), Native Hawaiians (n = 205), and Japanese Americans (n = 203). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of blood leukocyte DNA was measured using the Illumina 450K BeadChip array. Average beta value, the ratio of signal from a methylated probe relative to the sum of the methylated and unmethylated probes at that CpG, was the dependent variables in linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, race (for pan-ethnic analysis), and estimated cell-type distribution.        Results: We found that NE was significantly associated with six differentially methylated CpG sites (Bonferroni corrected p < 1.48 x 10-7): four in or near the FOXK2, PBX1, FNDC7, and FUBP3 genes and two in non-annotated genetic regions. Higher levels of NE were associated with increasing methylation beta-valuesin all six sites. For all six CpG sites, the association was only observed in Native Hawaiians, suggesting that the influence of smoking dose on DNA methylation patterns is heterogeneous across race/ethnicity (p interactions < 8.8 x 10-8). We found two additional CpG sites associated with NE in only Native Hawaiians.        Conclusions: In conclusion, internal smoking dose was associated with increased DNA methylation in circulating leukocytes at specific sites in Native Hawaiian smokers but not in white or Japanese American smokers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: smoking",10.1186/s13148-018-0543-7,"HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR;EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;LUNG-CANCER;TOBACCO-SMOKE;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;DIFFERENT RISKS;ETHNIC/RACIAL GROUPS;URINARY METABOLITES;NICOTINE METABOLISM;HUMAN GENOME;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Smoke;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",,

However, no study has evaluated whether short-term temperature fluctuations could affect DNA methylation. Methods: Peripheral blood DNA methylation for 479 female siblings of 130 families were analysed. Gridded daily temperatures data were obtained, linked to each participant's home address, and used to calculate nine different metrics of short-term temperature fluctuations: temperature variabilities (TVs) within the day of blood draw and preceding one to seven days (TV 0-1 to TV 0-7), diurnal temperature range (DTR), and temperature change between neighbouring days (TCN). Within-sibship design was used to perform epigenome-wide association analyses, adjusting for daily mean temperatures, and other important covariates (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, celltype proportions). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were further identified. Multiple-testing comparisons with a significant threshold of 0.01 for cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) and 0.05 for DMRs were applied. Results: Among 479 participants (mean age +/- SD, 56.4 +/- 7.9 years), we identified significant changes in methylation levels in 14 CpGs and 70 DMRs associated with temperature fluctuations. Almost all identified CpGs were associated with exposure to temperature fluctuations within three days. Differentially methylated signals were mapped to 68 genes that were linked to human diseases such as cancer (e.g., colorectal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and metastatic neoplasms) and mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, mental depression, and bipolar disorder). The top three most significantly enriched gene ontology terms were Response to bacterium (TV 0-3), followed by Hydrolase activity, acting on ester bonds (TCN), and Oxidoreductase activity (TV 0-3). Conclusions: Short-term temperature fluctuations were associated with differentially methylated signals across the human genome, which provides evidence on the potential biological mechanisms underlying the health impact of temperature fluctuations. Future studies are needed to further clarify the roles of DNA methylation in diseases associated with temperature fluctuations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ambient temperature",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107655,BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;DNA METHYLATION;RESPONSES;Epigenomics;Temperature,,

Blood DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many other environmental exposures, but to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between blood DNA methylation and glyphosate exposure.        OBJECTIVE: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with urinary glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) levels. Secondary goals were to determine the association of epigenetic age acceleration with glyphosate and AMPA and develop blood DNA methylation indices to predict urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels.        METHODS: For 392 postmenopausal women, white blood cell DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in two urine samples per participant using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methylation differences at the probe and regional level associated with glyphosate and AMPA levels were assessed using a resampling-based approach. Probes and regions that had an false discovery rate q< 0.1 in >= 90% of 1,000 subsamples of the study population were considered differentially methylated. Differentially methylated sites from the probe-specific analysis were combined into a methylation index. Epigenetic age acceleration from three epigenetic clocks and an epigenetic measure of pace of aging were examined for associations with glyphosate and AMPA.        RESULTS: We identified 24 CpG sites whose methylation level was associated with urinary glyphosate concentration and two associated with AMPA. Four regions, within the promoters of the MSH4, KCNA6, ABAT, and NDUFAF2/ERCC8 genes, were associated with glyphosate levels, along with an association between ESR1 promoter hypomethylation and AMPA. The methylation index accurately predicted glyphosate levels in an internal validation cohort. AMPA, but not glyphosate, was associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration.        DISCUSSION: Glyphosate and AMPA exposure were associated with DNA methylation differences that could promote the development of cancer and other diseases. Further studies are warranted to replicate our results, determine the functional impact of glyphosate- and AMPA-associated differential DNA methylation, and further explore whether DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker of glyphosate exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jari""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PMS,herbicide",10.1289/EHP10174,BIOMARKER;ADULTS;TIME;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Postmenopause;DNA,,
