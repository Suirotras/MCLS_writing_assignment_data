Smoking	Current smokers vs. Never smokers	4	0.97	NA	0.97	NA	NA	Finally, the performance of cotinine, DNA methylation (either at individual CpGs or a methylation score based on selected CpGs), and their combinations for discriminating current smokers from never smokers, and former smokers from never smokers was first evaluated in the discovery subset and then validated in the validation subset by areas under the curve (AUC) derived from logistic regression. The methylation score was developed through stepwise selection (with significance levels for deletion from and adding to the model of 0.01) of the confirmed CpGs in logistic regression model and calculated as ?1M1+?2M2+…+?nMn, where ? refers to the ?-regression coefficient of the selected CpG and M refers to the methylation level at that locus. As a previously recommended cutpoint of serum cotinine for distinguishing smokers and nonsmokers in adults was 4.85 ng/ml (Benowitz et al., 2009), we performed sensitivity analyses by excluding never and former smokers with cotinine level >4.85 ng/ml and current smokers with cotinine level ?4.85 ng/ml. Methylation score gave best AUC

Using the pROC package in R, the prediction accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) against the AUD diagnostic status as defined above.

MORE INFO: family setting (link = “logit”). Estimation of the variance explained by the MS and PGS, was based on the approach proposed by Lee et al., where coefficients of determination (R2) for binary responses are calculated on the liability scale (54). R2 is equal to the explained variance divided by the total variance; that is the sum of explained variance and residual (homoscedastic) variance. We first regressed the trait on the MS, sex, age and EWAS covariates (model 1a), and then on sex, age, and EWAS covariates only (model 1b). We calculated variance explained by all predictors in each model. We calculated the predictive value of the MS by subtracting the difference between the variance explained by the model 1a and 1b. The same was done for models with PGS with sex, age, and GWAS covariates (model 2a and 2b), and then for combined model with both MS and PGS scores (models 3a-c). In the last case, the difference between explained variance in model 3a and model 3b gave us an estimate explained by MS, and the difference between explained variance in model 3a and model 3c resulted in estimate explained by PGS."
