Furthermore, it has been known that DNA methylation profiling is susceptible to batch effects�and by white cell composition in whole blood.�Thus, �batch effects� and �white cell blood counts� were adjusted for to minimize confounding effects that may result in spurious association. To account for batch effects, �lab�, �experiment date�, �plate�, �row� and �column� were adjusted for in the analyses. The measured or imputed�white blood cell counts for CD4 cells, CD8 cells, natural killer cells, B cells and monocytes were adjusted for in the analyses.

A Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.05 (nominal p-value of 2.18�10?6) and False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-value of 0.05 (Giovino 2002) were applied to adjust for multiple testing of 22,927 autosomal DNAm sites. For the DNAm sites that were found to be significantly associated with current smoking status, the beta values were plotted against smoking status, stratified by sex. We mapped smoking-related DNAm sites to known human genes based on chromosomal location (NCBI 36.1). The top ten principal components of 668,293 genome-wide SNP markers were computed among 850 GENOA AAs with both GWAS and DNAm data as previously described (Arnett et al. 2011). The first two principal components were included as covariates in the regression model to adjust for potential effects of genetic admixture on smoking-related DNAm sites in both discovery and replication cohorts. We estimated the proportions of PLC subtypes for each sample using an algorithm developed for 27K chip data (Houseman et al.). The proportions of six different cell types, including granulocyte, monocyte, natural killer cells (NK), B cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, were projected based on top 100 cell-type specific DNAm sites. We included the proportions of PLC subtypes as covariates to assess the association between DNAm and cigarette smoking in a multiple regression model.

As a sensitivity analysis, each congener of PCB was associated separately with DNA methylation, with age, sex, and 24 surrogate variables, and the results from this analysis were correlated with the results from the main analysis using a Pearson�s correlation coefficient. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis controlling for cell type composition and lipid levels (in addition to age, sex, and the 24 surrogate variables) was conducted and the results from this analysis were correlated with the results from the main analysis using a Pearson�s correlation coefficient.

The potential technical bias was minimized using principal component analysis applied to the control probes included on the 450K chip (Lehne et�al. 2015). We included all PCs that explained �>�1% of the variance. This resulted in the inclusion of the first 7 PCs that together explained 95.5% of total variance. Additionally, the model was adjusted for the measured white blood cell counts (eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) to correct for the cellular heterogeneity of blood samples (Jaffe and Irizarry 2014).�

Mean temperature and relative humidity were added to the model as potential confounders because they have a relationship with both the temperature fluctuation and DNA methylation (Bind et al., 2014). Chronological age, BMI, smoking and drinking habits were regressed out as they were known covariates associating with DNA methylation (Ryan et al., 2020). Blood cell composition was added to the model to account for potential confounding by cell type due to their distinct methylation signatures (Montano et al., 2016).�
